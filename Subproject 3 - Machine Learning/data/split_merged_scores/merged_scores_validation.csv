2160,In its Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy1 the Commission mentions the possibility of linking new societal challenges such as improving public health and the employment situation to public procurement. The Commission does however state at the same time in its Green Paper that this can have a negative impact on the objective of reducing administrative burdens. 1. How will the Commission ensure that the introduction of social criteria does not result in greater administrative burdens and that access to public procurement is not impeded for SMEs in particular 2. Has the Commission considered how to avoid a situation in which public authorities impose requirements that only a  are able to meet and thus make use of this opportunity to favour certain  that already meet these requirements 3. Will the linking of certain requirements such as those on employment not make it necessary for the Commission to renegotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements with third countries 1Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy  Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market COM20110015.,E-005474/2011,0,In Green Paper modernisation EU public procurement policy Commission mention possibility linking new societal challenge improving public health employment situation public procurement The Commission however state time Green Paper negative impact objective reducing administrative burden How Commission ensure introduction social criterion result greater administrative burden access public procurement impeded SMEs particular Has Commission considered avoid situation public authority impose requirement able meet thus make use opportunity favour certain already meet requirement Will linking certain requirement employment make necessary Commission renegotiate bilateral multilateral agreement third country Green Paper modernisation EU public procurement policy Towards efficient European Procurement Market COM,PPE,Denmark,In it Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy the Commission mention the possibility of linking new societal challenge such a improving public health and the employment situation to public procurement The Commission doe however state at the same time in it Green Paper that this can have a negative impact on the objective of reducing administrative burden How will the Commission ensure that the introduction of social criterion doe not result in greater administrative burden and that access to public procurement is not impeded for SMEs in particular Has the Commission considered how to avoid a situation in which public authority impose requirement that only a are able to meet and thus make use of this opportunity to favour certain that already meet these requirement Will the linking of certain requirement such a those on employment not make it necessary for the Commission to renegotiate bilateral and multilateral agreement with third country Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market COM,Bendt Bendtsen
779,Context On 18 December 2015 the Swedish Government introduced a carrier liability law with the justification that the prevailing situation entailed a threat to public order and internal security. Under the law the Swedish Government can demand that  perform ID checks on passengers travelling by bus train or boat in either direction between Sweden and another Schengen area country. The Government also issued an ordinance on special ID checks on passengers travelling from Denmark to Sweden with the threat of a fine. The Law lapses on 21 December 2018. The Government can issue rules  ID checks for a period of six months at a time. The law and the ordinance have serious consequences for the 16  who cross the sea using the ??resund Bridge and they hamper tourism. The second part of Article 32 of the Schengen Agreement does not permit carrier liability. In an answer to a question E-003417/2015 the Commission has confirmed that carriers cannot  to perform ID checks on passengers crossing internal borders. Infringement proceedings brought by the Commission have also called this into question 20 February 2014. On 28 October the question was asked whether it could be confirmed that the same applied to the carrier liability that had been introduced in Sweden. Despite pressure the question has not been answered.

451,On 16 December 2013 Turkey is due to sign the Readmission agreement for third-country citizens. The agreement obliges Turkey to take back persons who have entered the EU illegally through that country. Turkey has never hidden its unsympathetic attitude in return for signing the agreement it wants visa liberalisation for all Turks. Turkeys blackmail seems to have succeeded  after signing the agreement the EU and Turkey are set to work on visa liberalisation1. Meanwhile the blackmail continues  Turkey is threatening in advance to halt the readmission of irregular migrants if the EU were to drag its feet  as Turkey sees it  on visa liberalisation2. Ahmet Davuto__lu Turkeys Minister for Foreign Affairs has firmly asserted that Turks will no longer need a visa to enter the European Union in no more than three and a half years. _tefan FÊ_le the EUs Commissioner for Enlargement has talked of a new dynamic in relations between Ankara and the EU. Mr FÊ_le however does not wish to put a deadline on  of visa liberalisation. 1. How does the Commission justify the fact that it has given in to Turkish blackmail by holding out the prospect of visa liberalisation for Turkey in return for it signing the readmission agreement Does the Commission share the view that it would not be unreasonable to expect what is after all a candidate country for EU membership to simply sign an agreement of this nature without in all arrogance demanding something in return In that context then how does the Commission explain its spinelessness 2. What is the Commissions assessment of the fact that Turkey is already threatening in advance to halt the readmission of irregular migrants if the EU were to drag its feet on visa liberalisation Does the Commission share the view that threatening behaviour of this kind is unacceptable from a candidate country for EU membership Does the Commission consequently share the view that Turkeys arrogant behaviour should in no way be rewarded but instead punished and that that should be done by means of putting an immediate stop to the accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey If not how will the Commission guarantee that unacceptable Turkish demands will not be acceded to in future 1  2 http//www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2800/Europese-Unie/article/detail/3556757/2013/12/05/Turken-mogen-zonder-visum-naar-EU-als-Turkije-illegale-immigrant-terugneemt.dhtml,E-013917-13,1,On December Turkey due sign Readmission agreement thirdcountry citizen The agreement obliges Turkey take back person entered EU illegally country Turkey never hidden unsympathetic attitude return signing agreement want visa liberalisation Turks Turkeys blackmail seems succeeded signing agreement EU Turkey set work visa liberalisation Meanwhile blackmail continues Turkey threatening advance halt readmission irregular migrant EU drag foot Turkey see visa liberalisation Ahmet Davuto lu Turkeys Minister Foreign Affairs firmly asserted Turks longer need visa enter European Union three half year tefan F Ê le EUs Commissioner Enlargement talked new dynamic relation Ankara EU Mr F Ê le however wish put deadline visa liberalisation How Commission justify fact given Turkish blackmail holding prospect visa liberalisation Turkey return signing readmission agreement Does Commission share view would unreasonable expect candidate country EU membership simply sign agreement nature without arrogance demanding something return In context Commission explain spinelessness What Commissions assessment fact Turkey already threatening advance halt readmission irregular migrant EU drag foot visa liberalisation Does Commission share view threatening behaviour kind unacceptable candidate country EU membership Does Commission consequently share view Turkeys arrogant behaviour way rewarded instead punished done mean putting immediate stop accession negotiation EU Turkey If Commission guarantee unacceptable Turkish demand acceded future httpwwwvolkskrantnlvknlEuropeseUniearticledetailTurkenmogenzondervisumnaarEUalsTurkijeillegaleimmigrantterugneemtdhtml,NI,Netherlands,On December Turkey is due to sign the Readmission agreement for thirdcountry citizen The agreement obliges Turkey to take back person who have entered the EU illegally through that country Turkey ha never hidden it unsympathetic attitude in return for signing the agreement it want visa liberalisation for all Turks Turkeys blackmail seems to have succeeded after signing the agreement the EU and Turkey are set to work on visa liberalisation Meanwhile the blackmail continues Turkey is threatening in advance to halt the readmission of irregular migrant if the EU were to drag it foot a Turkey see it on visa liberalisation Ahmet Davuto lu Turkeys Minister for Foreign Affairs ha firmly asserted that Turks will no longer need a visa to enter the European Union in no more than three and a half year tefan F Ê le the EUs Commissioner for Enlargement ha talked of a new dynamic in relation between Ankara and the EU Mr F Ê le however doe not wish to put a deadline on of visa liberalisation How doe the Commission justify the fact that it ha given in to Turkish blackmail by holding out the prospect of visa liberalisation for Turkey in return for it signing the readmission agreement Does the Commission share the view that it would not be unreasonable to expect what is after all a candidate country for EU membership to simply sign an agreement of this nature without in all arrogance demanding something in return In that context then how doe the Commission explain it spinelessness What is the Commissions assessment of the fact that Turkey is already threatening in advance to halt the readmission of irregular migrant if the EU were to drag it foot on visa liberalisation Does the Commission share the view that threatening behaviour of this kind is unacceptable from a candidate country for EU membership Does the Commission consequently share the view that Turkeys arrogant behaviour should in no way be rewarded but instead punished and that that should be done by mean of putting an immediate stop to the accession negotiation between the EU and Turkey If not how will the Commission guarantee that unacceptable Turkish demand will not be acceded to in future httpwwwvolkskrantnlvknlEuropeseUniearticledetailTurkenmogenzondervisumnaarEUalsTurkijeillegaleimmigrantterugneemtdhtml,Laurence J.A.J.

1526,In a number of European countries considerable nonconventional shale gas reserves have been discovered. The discovery of shale gas is being described by some as a revolution in the world of gas. The potential is enormous as shale beds could contain hundreds of billions of cubic metres of gas including in the Netherlands where a number  have been given authorisation to carry out exploratory drilling to assess the feasibility of extracting shale gas. Areas where drilling is taking place include Boxtel and Haaren. However this new way of obtaining gas is not without its risks. Along with its enormous potential drilling for shale gas can also have negative effects. This has been seen for example in the American state of Pennsylvania where there are a total of 71 000 wells which according to an investigation have seriously contaminated waste water. Citizens of European Member States read reports about this and are rightly concerned about the effects on their own environment. Furthermore research carried out by parties exploiting the gas do not inspire them with confidence. When looking at the various exploratory drilling projects in the Member States does the Commission consider the impact of such activities on groundwater and drinking water quality Will the Commission carry out research within a European context into the various effects of shale gas extraction on the environment Will the Commission devote attention to the development of techniques enabling shale gas to be extracted from various types of strata without causing negative effects Does the Commission agree that large-scale shale gas exploration activities cannot go ahead until we are clear about what impact they will have,E-005303/2011,0,In number European country considerable nonconventional shale gas reserve discovered The discovery shale gas described revolution world gas The potential enormous shale bed could contain hundred billion cubic metre gas including Netherlands number given authorisation carry exploratory drilling ass feasibility extracting shale gas Areas drilling taking place include Boxtel Haaren However new way obtaining gas without risk Along enormous potential drilling shale gas also negative effect This seen example American state Pennsylvania total well according investigation seriously contaminated waste water Citizens European Member States read report rightly concerned effect environment Furthermore research carried party exploiting gas inspire confidence When looking various exploratory drilling project Member States Commission consider impact activity groundwater drinking water quality Will Commission carry research within European context various effect shale gas extraction environment Will Commission devote attention development technique enabling shale gas extracted various type stratum without causing negative effect Does Commission agree largescale shale gas exploration activity cannot go ahead clear impact,PPE,Netherlands,In a number of European country considerable nonconventional shale gas reserve have been discovered The discovery of shale gas is being described by some a a revolution in the world of gas The potential is enormous a shale bed could contain hundred of billion of cubic metre of gas including in the Netherlands where a number have been given authorisation to carry out exploratory drilling to ass the feasibility of extracting shale gas Areas where drilling is taking place include Boxtel and Haaren However this new way of obtaining gas is not without it risk Along with it enormous potential drilling for shale gas can also have negative effect This ha been seen for example in the American state of Pennsylvania where there are a total of well which according to an investigation have seriously contaminated waste water Citizens of European Member States read report about this and are rightly concerned about the effect on their own environment Furthermore research carried out by party exploiting the gas do not inspire them with confidence When looking at the various exploratory drilling project in the Member States doe the Commission consider the impact of such activity on groundwater and drinking water quality Will the Commission carry out research within a European context into the various effect of shale gas extraction on the environment Will the Commission devote attention to the development of technique enabling shale gas to be extracted from various type of stratum without causing negative effect Does the Commission agree that largescale shale gas exploration activity cannot go ahead until we are clear about what impact they will have,Lambert van Nistelrooij
1927,On Sunday 4 July 2010 violent action by Moroccan police left dozens of Sahrawis injured in El AaiÊ_n a Moroccan occupied city in Western Sahara. A large number of people had gathered in front of the family home of Mahfud Ali Baiba the recently deceased President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to extend their condolences to the family. However the Moroccan authorities prevented access to the house. The Sahrawis waiting there organised a spontaneous protest which the Moroccan police broke up using force. The Moroccan authorities also imposed a curfew on the airport and its surrounding areas. In a specific incident in the Dir Aida district Moroccan police officers checked the identity papers of Anuar Kamal who was then questioned struck repeatedly and insulted for having Polisario Front symbols in his possession. The European Union attaches great importance to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Morocco as stated by the Commission in its Answer No E3578/07.

700,The current Cantabrian Regional Government has received EUR 47 million from the European Social Fund ESF 2007-2013 for professional training projects and other employment-support and job-creation programmes. However we can see no progress in this regard unemployment is one of Cantabrias greatest problems.

1312,The Public Sector Employment  for recruitment to education posts in Navarre is scheduled for June 2016. In this connection the notice  published by the government of Navarre has triggered a wave of controversy and protest since 228 71.25 of the 320 posts will be for Basque speakers. Regional Law 18/1986 on the Basque Language of 15 December institutes Basque as a joint official language in certain parts of Navarre but Spanish remains the official language in Navarre and throughout Spanish territory and should therefore be a sufficient qualification for any Spanish citizen to have access to public sector jobs in accordance with the principle of equal opportunities. The percentage of posts for Basque speakers is moreover disproportionate and constitutes discrimination against those residents of Navarre and other Spaniards who have no knowledge of that language. In view of the above and with regard to Article 18 TFEU on non-discrimination and citizenship of the Union does the Commission consider that the OPE procedure followed by the government of  with EC law in so far as it discriminates against those citizens of Navarre who do not speak Basque and other Spanish citizens whose only language is Spanish,E-000447-16,0,The Public Sector Employment recruitment education post Navarre scheduled June In connection notice published government Navarre triggered wave controversy protest since post Basque speaker Regional Law Basque Language December institute Basque joint official language certain part Navarre Spanish remains official language Navarre throughout Spanish territory therefore sufficient qualification Spanish citizen access public sector job accordance principle equal opportunity The percentage post Basque speaker moreover disproportionate constitutes discrimination resident Navarre Spaniards knowledge language In view regard Article TFEU nondiscrimination citizenship Union Commission consider OPE procedure followed government EC law far discriminates citizen Navarre speak Basque Spanish citizen whose language Spanish,PPE,Spain,The Public Sector Employment for recruitment to education post in Navarre is scheduled for June In this connection the notice published by the government of Navarre ha triggered a wave of controversy and protest since of the post will be for Basque speaker Regional Law on the Basque Language of December institute Basque a a joint official language in certain part of Navarre but Spanish remains the official language in Navarre and throughout Spanish territory and should therefore be a sufficient qualification for any Spanish citizen to have access to public sector job in accordance with the principle of equal opportunity The percentage of post for Basque speaker is moreover disproportionate and constitutes discrimination against those resident of Navarre and other Spaniards who have no knowledge of that language In view of the above and with regard to Article TFEU on nondiscrimination and citizenship of the Union doe the Commission consider that the OPE procedure followed by the government of with EC law in so far a it discriminates against those citizen of Navarre who do not speak Basque and other Spanish citizen whose only language is Spanish,Pablo Zalba Bidegain

769,Ten years ago the government of Eritrea ordered the arrest of 21 prominent opposition figures and influential individuals who had openly criticised the way the President Isaias Afewerki was running the country. These arbitrary arrests have not only paved the way for the installation of a totalitarian state but also destroyed the countrys independent press. Apart from the fact that these men and women have not been formally charged with a crime the government has said nothing about their whereabouts or their state of health. According to Human Rights Watch several of the incarcerated people have died in their cells while the rest are suffering from diseases needing medical treatment. So far human rights organisations have not been allowed to enter the country and there are no accredited foreign journalists to report or investigate these cases. Parliament adopted a resolution on the specific case of Dawit Isaak and also on the human rights situation in Eritrea and the EU has voiced its concern on several occasions through its High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton.

2516,I am extremely concerned at the alarming reports from Burundi. Acts of political violence have worsened since April this year when the President of Burundi announced his intention of seeking a third  disregarding his countrys constitution. Since then there has been a worrying increase in violence roundups of people and enforced disappearances. More and more members of the opposition human rights activists and civilians are being murdered. There is a risk of conflagration in the region. There must therefore be vigorous and immediate EU diplomatic efforts to ensure that the gruesome process getting under way in the country is halted as soon as possible.

597,A recent report by the Greens/EFA in the European Parliament1 indicates that the introduction of a financial transaction tax in the European Union or eurozone would help stabilise the financial system and avert systemic risks while generating a substantial revenue of between EUR 80 billion and EUR 190 billion annually or thereabouts. This revenue could play a major role in protecting savings and banks without the need for painful cuts in vital welfare expenditure and in funding the increased investment urgently necessary for a greener economy with a view to emerging from the economic social and environmental crisis at the same time. In view of this 1. Is the Commission aware of this report 2. What actions will it take to promote this measure 3.

158,It is widely known that since 1985 the area given over to hop-growing in the province of Leon Spain has been drastically reduced to the point where only half of the original area of 2000 hectares is under production. This situation has brought serious social consequences as a result of the job losses caused in an area with serious unemployment problems and the attempt to reduce the area under production still further will irreparably worsen this terrible social scourge. In addition it has been amply demonstrated that there are no reasonably viable alternative crops which might offer a solution to the deepening problem that any further reductions in hop-growing would create. In the light of this disturbing situation will the Commission consider using as a reference point for any possible reductions the surface area under crops in 1985 bearing in mind that sufficient and substantial reductions have been made since that date,E-1456/98,0,It widely known since area given hopgrowing province Leon Spain drastically reduced point half original area hectare production This situation brought serious social consequence result job loss caused area serious unemployment problem attempt reduce area production still irreparably worsen terrible social scourge In addition amply demonstrated reasonably viable alternative crop might offer solution deepening problem reduction hopgrowing would create In light disturbing situation Commission consider using reference point possible reduction surface area crop bearing mind sufficient substantial reduction made since date,PPE,Spain,It is widely known that since the area given over to hopgrowing in the province of Leon Spain ha been drastically reduced to the point where only half of the original area of hectare is under production This situation ha brought serious social consequence a a result of the job loss caused in an area with serious unemployment problem and the attempt to reduce the area under production still further will irreparably worsen this terrible social scourge In addition it ha been amply demonstrated that there are no reasonably viable alternative crop which might offer a solution to the deepening problem that any further reduction in hopgrowing would create In the light of this disturbing situation will the Commission consider using a a reference point for any possible reduction the surface area under crop in bearing in mind that sufficient and substantial reduction have been made since that date,Felipe Camisón Asensio

2873,The NER300 funding mechanism administered by the European Commission will be used to fund up to 8 carbon capture and storage CCS projects and 34 renewable energy projects across Europe. Projects will be ranked in increasing order of cost-per-unit performance. The European Investment Bank EIB has performed the financial and technical due diligence assessment on the proposed projects including their ranking and sent this to the Commission in February 2012. The Commission will make award decisions based on this ranking in the second half of 2012. It is unclear if the environmental impacts of CCS projects have been adequately considered in the EIBs due diligence assessment. Furthermore it is unclear how environmental impacts will be taken into account by the Commission prior to making award decisions. One of the UK CCS projects at Hunterston in Scotland would cause direct damage to a nationally designated site and the Scottish Governments statutory nature conservation adviser has raised serious concerns regarding the potential for impacts on Natura 2000 sites from the Hunterston development. 1.

2845,Aids violence and poverty have made Haiti one of the most important countries for adoptions. About 1 300 Haitians are adopted abroad every year. Even before the earthquake hundreds of thousands of orphans lived in orphanages and on the streets. Many European families would now like to help by adopting a child. Some countries including France the Netherlands and the USA are planning to simplify the formalities in this respect. In principle the Commission advises against fast-track adoption procedures. That makes sense in order to prevent illegal adoptions and human trafficking. After all experience has demonstrated that human traffickers profit all too willingly from the chaos after natural disasters. During legal adoption procedures candidates for adoption are vetted and the childrens situation and documents are also checked. Now that the state institutions have been mostly destroyed it is currently almost impossible to determine whether a child still has relatives. 1. Are efforts being made at EU level to accelerate adoptions which were already approved before the earthquake 2. What is the EUs general position on adoptions from third countries 3.

707,Portuguese farmers either directly or through their associations have until 15 May 2008 to submit applications under the PRODER programme for agri-environmental and/or silvi-environmental payments and integrated territorial interventions for 2008 which do not include applications for the sheep and goat premium and  payment. The deadline for applications including the sheep and goat premium is 30 April 20081. However information received shows that in Portugal applications are being authorised only from farmers who had pre-registered by November 2007 with the normal application deadlines laid down for 2008 being suspended and  system for receiving applications being blocked for applicants who failed to pre-register. According to the same reports the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture is now demanding that Portuguese farmers already pre-register for 2009. As the Commission is aware finalising such applications entails numerous formalities such as the submission of contracts with certain bodies in particular external bodies that monitor organic farming methods. Can the Commission answer the following questions 1. Can the Commission confirm whether or not Portuguese farmers regardless of whether or not they have pre-registered are still entitled to submit applications within the deadlines laid down up to 30 April or 15 May depending on the type of support If the government is failing to respect the deadlines laid down for all those wishing to submit applications  would the Commission make on this situation 2.

1835,On 08 February 2016 the Israeli government decided to strip three Members of the United Arab List party of their parliamentary privileges accusing them of having visited the families of Palestinians killed in clashes with the security forces and accused of terrorism. The three Members reported that they had visited the families of the deceased in order to reassure them that the dead bodies of their children would be returned soon since the Israeli authorities are generally slow to hand over the dead. However the government proceeded to temporarily strip these Members of their parliamentary privileges such as freedom of expression in plenary. This is a flagrant violation of human rights and also a bid to silence the voice of the Palestinians in the Knesset. The situation in the region has recently been very tense the Israeli authorities have been taking violent repression and restriction measures against Palestinian civilians following government instructions supposedly intended to fight terrorism. There is a serious risk that this decision to temporarily strip these Members of their parliamentary privileges may trigger a new wave of violence and clashes.

1965,Every year hundreds of cruise ships enter the lagoon of Venice declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco. They sail through the entire historical centre on their way to their moorings and pass within no more than a few dozen metres of the Doges Palace and St Marks Square. In 2010 alone 629 ships with a total of 1 617 011 passengers entered the lagoon a figure which increased sharply in 2011. This increasing volume of traffic is obviously causing serious problems for Venice such as a the displacement of enormous amounts of water is affecting the canal banks and the foundations of buildings b the polluting sedimentary deposits on the canal beds are being stirred up by the movement of the large propellers c the atmospheric pollution caused by emissions from the ships funnels is having adverse effects on human health and the environment. It is perfectly clear that in the event of an accident caused by human error or sabotage the proximity of large ships to the citys buildings could cause incalculable and probably irreparable damage to Venices environment and historical heritage. The devastating shipwreck of the Costa Concordia on 13 January 2012 just off the island of Giglio Grosseto which is in the National Park of the Tuscan Archipelago and is a sanctuary for marine mammals shows that despite advanced technology and highly professional staff accidents with disastrous consequences are an everyday possibility. Under Directive 1999/32/EC1 fuel which is much more polluting than motor vehicle fuel may be used for maritime transport purposes. In 2007 Entec UK published the IIASA study on maritime emissions2 which highlights the human health risks involved. In light of the above and with regard to ships in the city of Venice would the Commission not agree that 1. It should ask the Italian authorities to take urgent action to find solutions which  with the extremely delicate ecosystem of Venices lagoon the specific features of this historical city and the health of local inhabitants by establishing purpose-built facilities for ships outside the citys historical centre and the lagoon 2.

1956,Manfredonia has been included by Law 426/98 as a site of national interest SNI. The Environment Ministry has demarcated the extension of the SNI in both private and public areas. Most of the territory of the public areas consists of the marine area facing the chemical plant and includes the entire Alti Fondali industrial port. The Military Geographic Institute map used for the demarcating the area published in the Official Gazette on 26 February 2000 shows that that port is excluded from the SNI.

2089,In adopting Regulation EEC No. 1101/89  the Council introduced measures for structural improvements in inland waterway transport aimed primarily at reducing the overcapacity of fleets through scrapping schemes coordinated at Community level. For this purpose the Member States concerned provided their scrapping funds by drawing on their national budgets with the financial resources needed to offer a scrapping premium to shipowners who submitted their applications by 30 June 1994 in accordance with Regulation EEC No. 3039/94 . However as a result of the sectors economic difficulties further applications for scrapping premiums were submitted to the national scrapping funds after the deadline.

2598,Under Regulation EEC 3118/93 which lays down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road haulage services within a Member State cabotage transport operations are defined as road passenger transport services operated temporarily by a carrier established in one Member State in another Member State without having a registered office or other establishment in that State. The carriers in question are however subject in a number of respects to the legislation rules and administrative provisions in force in the host Member State. The road transport package adopted in 2009 included Regulation EC 1072/09  rules for access to the international road haulage market. This regulation allows hauliers to carry out up to three cabotage operations within seven days following international carriage of goods from another Member State subject to various additional provisions emphasising the temporary nature of cabotage operations. The regulation serves to tighten up the rules on cabotage on the basis of various provisions which enable the Member States to introduce safeguard measures in the event of serious disturbance of their national transport market. The Commission has been planning for several months to liberalise the cabotage system as of 1 January 2014. The aim is in fact to deepen the single European market by replacing the system introduced by the 2009 agreement on road transport. However this liberalisation would lead to  between the Member States hauliers due to the fact that social policy is not harmonised in the EU. This raises the issue of statutory minimum welfare provision. Differences between EU Member States in terms of salaries working conditions etc continue to exist and give rise to widespread social dumping. The Transport Commissioner however has recently called Europes determination to liberalise the cabotage system into question and finally advocated better implementation and simplification of the existing rules to help road transport operators which are suffering the effects of  1. What approach does the Commission plan to adopt Does it intend to take the necessary measures to liberalise road cabotage operations or will it simply clarify and improve the implementation of the existing legislation on the subject 2.

1782,Various hunting organisations in the Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country and Navarre have expressed their disquiet to us at certain restrictions to the hunting of the wood pigeon. The species is not listed is increasing in number and neither nests nor overwinters in the area. In principle it is hunted for four or five days in October as it flies over these two regions on its way to its wintering grounds. The hunting of returning migratory birds would allow the species to be captured during the few days in March when the pigeons mainly return north. The hunters believe that this is not a mere extension of the hunting season because in these regions it would be possible to hunt for many fewer days than in those territories where the species nests or overwinters. This is a traditional form of hunting as it takes place from stations known to exist since the Middle Ages. Furthermore it is a social activity as places are assigned by the strict drawing of lots and fees of around EUR 4 are paid per place per day. Hunting takes place under strictly controlled conditions limited number of daily licenses daily quota of birds shot and subsequent monitoring of each hunters days hunting. These restrictions mean that there is appropriate use of this hunting resource with a maximum seasonal quota of 3 000 captures. On account of this they believe that they have no impact on the conservation status of the species. On account of these reasons they believe that the return of migrating birds falls under the exception contained in Article 9.1.c of Community Directive 2009/147/CEE  Birds Directive. In the light of the prohibition of hunting returning migratory birds we would like to know Does the Commission consider that the exceptional authorisation of hunting returning migratory wood pigeon under the aforementioned circumstances can be interpreted as a satisfactory solution Article 9.1 of Community Directive 2009/147/CEE  Birds Directive especially seen in contrast with the fact that in the south of the Iberian Peninsula where it overwinters it can be hunted from October to January  ES C 66 E 07/03/2013,E-000002/2012,0,Various hunting organisation Autonomous Communities Basque Country Navarre expressed disquiet u certain restriction hunting wood pigeon The specie listed increasing number neither nest overwinters area In principle hunted four five day October fly two region way wintering ground The hunting returning migratory bird would allow specie captured day March pigeon mainly return north The hunter believe mere extension hunting season region would possible hunt many fewer day territory specie nest overwinters This traditional form hunting take place station known exist since Middle Ages Furthermore social activity place assigned strict drawing lot fee around EUR paid per place per day Hunting take place strictly controlled condition limited number daily license daily quota bird shot subsequent monitoring hunter day hunting These restriction mean appropriate use hunting resource maximum seasonal quota capture On account believe impact conservation status specie On account reason believe return migrating bird fall exception contained Article c Community Directive CEE Birds Directive In light prohibition hunting returning migratory bird would like know Does Commission consider exceptional authorisation hunting returning migratory wood pigeon aforementioned circumstance interpreted satisfactory solution Article Community Directive CEE Birds Directive especially seen contrast fact south Iberian Peninsula overwinters hunted October January ES C E,ALDE,Spain,Various hunting organisation in the Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country and Navarre have expressed their disquiet to u at certain restriction to the hunting of the wood pigeon The specie is not listed is increasing in number and neither nest nor overwinters in the area In principle it is hunted for four or five day in October a it fly over these two region on it way to it wintering ground The hunting of returning migratory bird would allow the specie to be captured during the few day in March when the pigeon mainly return north The hunter believe that this is not a mere extension of the hunting season because in these region it would be possible to hunt for many fewer day than in those territory where the specie nest or overwinters This is a traditional form of hunting a it take place from station known to exist since the Middle Ages Furthermore it is a social activity a place are assigned by the strict drawing of lot and fee of around EUR are paid per place per day Hunting take place under strictly controlled condition limited number of daily license daily quota of bird shot and subsequent monitoring of each hunter day hunting These restriction mean that there is appropriate use of this hunting resource with a maximum seasonal quota of capture On account of this they believe that they have no impact on the conservation status of the specie On account of these reason they believe that the return of migrating bird fall under the exception contained in Article c of Community Directive CEE Birds Directive In the light of the prohibition of hunting returning migratory bird we would like to know Does the Commission consider that the exceptional authorisation of hunting returning migratory wood pigeon under the aforementioned circumstance can be interpreted a a satisfactory solution Article of Community Directive CEE Birds Directive especially seen in contrast with the fact that in the south of the Iberian Peninsula where it overwinters it can be hunted from October to January ES C E,Izaskun Bilbao Barandica

2398,A question for a written answer P007464/2017 was tabled to the Commission in December 2017 concerning the marketing authorisation procedure for Aplidin as a medicinal product for multiple myeloma. The application for marketing authorisation was filed by the pharmaceutical firm PharmaMar. The Commission gave its answer in January 2018. However it is still not clear why despite two verbal submissions and favourable reports by the rapporteur and co-rapporteur the final decision by the CHMP was negative. There is now a period of 60 days during which PharmaMar may submit its grounds for a reexamination. It should be noted in this respect that the Myeloma Patients Europe association is also particularly interested in knowing where the procedure now stands.

659,Although it is almost three years since the first licences were issued for the installation operation and marketing of third generation mobile  in the EU Member States the sector has failed to meet the forecasts and expectations of both enterprises and consumers. The sometimes exorbitant cost of acquiring a third generation mobile telephony licence the very expensive nature of the equipment to support this technology and of the services offered and the lack of interoperability among networks at European level are among the causes underlying the problem. At the same time as part of its revision of the European regulatory framework for  the Commission is examining possible changes to the way in which the radio spectrum is used and divided up. These changes are arousing well-founded fears of a fresh and serious blow to the European market in third generation mobile  with the increased distribution and installation of long-range broadband wireless networks WiMAX in many EU regions. In the light of the above will the Commission say 1. whether it has statistics on the rate of penetration and utilisation of third generation services in all Member States of the European Union and in Greece in particular 2. what the situation is as regards tariff policy in the Member States and whether it intends to take steps to help consumers by cutting prices in the same way that it has done in its efforts to rationalise roaming charges 3. how it views the future of this sector in the light of the rapid expansion of telephony and  services via the Internet,E-3964/06,0,Although almost three year since first licence issued installation operation marketing third generation mobile EU Member States sector failed meet forecast expectation enterprise consumer The sometimes exorbitant cost acquiring third generation mobile telephony licence expensive nature equipment support technology service offered lack interoperability among network European level among cause underlying problem At time part revision European regulatory framework Commission examining possible change way radio spectrum used divided These change arousing wellfounded fear fresh serious blow European market third generation mobile increased distribution installation longrange broadband wireless network WiMAX many EU region In light Commission say whether statistic rate penetration utilisation third generation service Member States European Union Greece particular situation regard tariff policy Member States whether intends take step help consumer cutting price way done effort rationalise roaming charge view future sector light rapid expansion telephony service via Internet,,Greece,Although it is almost three year since the first licence were issued for the installation operation and marketing of third generation mobile in the EU Member States the sector ha failed to meet the forecast and expectation of both enterprise and consumer The sometimes exorbitant cost of acquiring a third generation mobile telephony licence the very expensive nature of the equipment to support this technology and of the service offered and the lack of interoperability among network at European level are among the cause underlying the problem At the same time a part of it revision of the European regulatory framework for the Commission is examining possible change to the way in which the radio spectrum is used and divided up These change are arousing wellfounded fear of a fresh and serious blow to the European market in third generation mobile with the increased distribution and installation of longrange broadband wireless network WiMAX in many EU region In the light of the above will the Commission say whether it ha statistic on the rate of penetration and utilisation of third generation service in all Member States of the European Union and in Greece in particular what the situation is a regard tariff policy in the Member States and whether it intends to take step to help consumer by cutting price in the same way that it ha done in it effort to rationalise roaming charge how it view the future of this sector in the light of the rapid expansion of telephony and service via the Internet,Georgios Papastamkos

1865,The Vice-President/High Representative will have read reports of the unprecedented historic ceasefire negotiated on 12.1.2012 between the Burmese Government and the ethnic minority Karen population who have traditionally sought an element of autonomy from central governmental control bringing to an end what has been labelled the longest running insurgency in history. This detente is the latest in a series of apparently progressive steps that Rangoon has made in order to seek legitimacy on the world stage through democratic reforms in the hope of ending its international isolation. The most celebrated and publicised of these moves was the release from long-term house arrest of the celebrated opposition politician and Sakharov Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi in 2011. Following high-level separate visits from both British Foreign Secretary William Hague and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the Burmese Government has gone on to its great credit to pledge the release of over 600 political prisoners.

1804,So far a total of 180 hectares of the protected woodland in the Aggtelek National Park in Hungary has been felled in practice this amounts to 98  of the total stand of trees. Only 2 hectares of woodland remains but trees are continuously being cut from there too. Since 2004 the wood has belonged to the European Unions Natura 2000 network being classified as a Special Area of Conservation which is one of the largest and most valuable oak/ash/elm hardwood gallery-forest biotope types in the region. The wood was a place of refuge for many species of animal protected under Hungarian nature conservation law and European law until wood thieves with their axes and chainsaws cleared it. Within a short time the destruction of the SajÊ_lÊd woodland has caused irreversible damage eliminating valuable and rare forest ecosystems and causing the disappearance of animal species of Community importance which are protected or specially protected.

3003,Pursuant to Directive 91/439/EEC1 Annex III Article 6 SIGHT all applicants for a driving licence or extension of a driving licence are required to undergo an appropriate investigation to ensure that they have adequate visual acuity for driving power-driven vehicles.  As a result of this provision some people who were declared eligible for a Group 2 driving licence before the directive entered into force may suddenly find that they are not eligible for an extension even though in reality nothing has changed and their eyesight has therefore not actually deteriorated. In other words the circumstances are exactly the same as they were when the person in question was certified fit to drive.

However this does not solve the problem if people wish to drive beyond a particular border.

1112,Russia is still occupying over 20 of Georgias internationally recognised territory. In the occupied territories gross violations of human rights including arbitrary detention restriction of freedom of movement and mass infringement of property rights continue to be reported.

131,Commission Proposal No 2017/0293 COD amending Regulation EC No 715/2007 deals with the issue of exemption. According to the draft meeting the specific emissions targets set on the basis of the intended purpose of vehicles disproportionately affects the smallest manufacturers and the derogation procedure represents an excessive administrative burden for the Commission and rates the benefit that can be measured in the reduction of CO2 emissions achieved in connection with motor vehicle sales by these manufacturers as negligible. According to the draft in the case of market niche manufacturers the derogations allowed until 2025 will remain in place while in respect of the subsequent period manufacturers will have to meet a standard established by technical calculations which require special technical expertise. It follows from the mentality of the whole proposal viz. a series of incentives that individual agreements tailored to individual manufacturers may be involved under which a very high number of aspects are taken into consideration including the reasons for the derogations granted. By contrast opinions were also formed during the discussion of the proposal that the derogation scheme must be  even prematurely. 1. Is there any internal interpretation/intent that the obligation to meet the requirements after 2025 may be inconsistent with the derogations if any granted for the 2025-2030 period 2. Does the Commission want to distinguish between market niche manufacturers and large manufacturers in respect of the achievement of the CO2 target 3.

1240,In September 2002 the  of the Italian ministry of the economy presented its statement on the expenditure of funding made available by the European Union. Its research showed that some local authorities were worryingly slow and inefficient in awarding projects.

1084,The financial crisis triggered by US derivatives products has affected many banks some of which  in view of the size of their losses  have been rescued by means of public intervention. In Italy however the black hole has been caused by derivatives contracts i.e. the system by means of which local businesses and organisations obtain money from banks in order to limit their deficits. It would appear that rather than covering the risks those products have multiplied them. The most significant statistic apart from the potential losses from derivatives which are already huge is provided by the fact that the banks Deutsche Bank UBS JP Morgan and DEPFA Bank have earned 440 times more than what was stated in the contracts. In the case of the derivative valued at almost EUR 1.7 billion which was signed in 2005 by the Milan city authorities it appears that  was expected to be 0.01  i.e. a total of EUR 170 000 to be divided amongst the four banks. So far however the banks have earned at least EUR 75 million in implicit costs according to the data extracted from the Bloomberg Terminals and as reported by the Panorama weekly news magazine. An investigation has been opened by the judiciary and it should reveal whether fraudulent contracts are to blame or  administrators. In the light of such an intractable and apparently inconceivable state of affairs will the Commission answer the following questions  Have similar situations also arisen in other EU countries  What view does the Commission take of these derivatives contracts and of the damage which they have caused thousands of small and medium-sized businesses being amongst the victims  In any event should the ECB not assess the extent to which certain financial  with the rules on transparency on fitness for purpose and on the proper use of public money in order to prevent banks from making profits too easily and clients from suffering inevitable loss  Does the Commission not think that the moment  for serious consideration to be given to the introduction of new rules applicable to the international financial system,E-3066/08,0,The financial crisis triggered US derivative product affected many bank view size loss rescued mean public intervention In Italy however black hole caused derivative contract ie system mean local business organisation obtain money bank order limit deficit It would appear rather covering risk product multiplied The significant statistic apart potential loss derivative already huge provided fact bank Deutsche Bank UBS JP Morgan DEPFA Bank earned time stated contract In case derivative valued almost EUR billion signed Milan city authority appears expected ie total EUR divided amongst four bank So far however bank earned least EUR million implicit cost according data extracted Bloomberg Terminals reported Panorama weekly news magazine An investigation opened judiciary reveal whether fraudulent contract blame administrator In light intractable apparently inconceivable state affair Commission answer following question Have similar situation also arisen EU country What view Commission take derivative contract damage caused thousand small mediumsized business amongst victim In event ECB ass extent certain financial rule transparency fitness purpose proper use public money order prevent bank making profit easily client suffering inevitable loss Does Commission think moment serious consideration given introduction new rule applicable international financial system,UEN,Italy,The financial crisis triggered by US derivative product ha affected many bank some of which in view of the size of their loss have been rescued by mean of public intervention In Italy however the black hole ha been caused by derivative contract ie the system by mean of which local business and organisation obtain money from bank in order to limit their deficit It would appear that rather than covering the risk those product have multiplied them The most significant statistic apart from the potential loss from derivative which are already huge is provided by the fact that the bank Deutsche Bank UBS JP Morgan and DEPFA Bank have earned time more than what wa stated in the contract In the case of the derivative valued at almost EUR billion which wa signed in by the Milan city authority it appears that wa expected to be ie a total of EUR to be divided amongst the four bank So far however the bank have earned at least EUR million in implicit cost according to the data extracted from the Bloomberg Terminals and a reported by the Panorama weekly news magazine An investigation ha been opened by the judiciary and it should reveal whether fraudulent contract are to blame or administrator In the light of such an intractable and apparently inconceivable state of affair will the Commission answer the following question Have similar situation also arisen in other EU country What view doe the Commission take of these derivative contract and of the damage which they have caused thousand of small and mediumsized business being amongst the victim In any event should the ECB not ass the extent to which certain financial with the rule on transparency on fitness for purpose and on the proper use of public money in order to prevent bank from making profit too easily and client from suffering inevitable loss Does the Commission not think that the moment for serious consideration to be given to the introduction of new rule applicable to the international financial system,Cristiana Muscardini

1529,On 5 July 2011 Parliaments plenary sitting approved the own-initiative report on a more efficient and fairer retail market 2010/2109INI by rapporteur Anna Maria Corazza Bildt.

1444,According to the World Health Organisation 19 million Europeans do not have access to a source of drinking water that is adequately protected or to safe sanitation and about 100 million people still lack access to piped water in their homes. The Commission has estimated that by 2007 at least 11 of Europes population and 17 of its territory had already been affected by water scarcity. While there is a framework for action in Europe its implementation has been rather weak. The Water Framework Directive WFD introduced in 2000 has set an objective to get all lakes rivers streams and groundwater aquifers into a healthy state by 2015 by taking an integrated ecosystem-based approach. It is likely that almost half of Europes water bodies will miss the target.

437,Some animal breeders are trying to increase their  with spectacular cross-breeding. According to media reports sheepdogs are increasingly being cross-bred with wolves in order to produce particularly aggressive and dangerous dogs which can however barely be controlled in extreme situations. A cat breeder has announced that she intends to cross-breed Maine Coon cats with caracals in order to create a super-cat. Maine Coons shoulder height is about 40cm. Grown males reach a length of 1.2 m from the nose to the tip of the tail and weigh up to 12 kg. Caracals Persian lynxes are distributed across Africa the Arabian Peninsula Turkey and Iran as far as the Aral Sea. They attain a length of about 95 cm a weight of 13 to 18 kg and a shoulder height of about 45 cm. They are predators which feed on hares and other rodents and are also capable of killing dwarf antelopes. Since caracals are wild animals and predators animal rights activists fear that the resulting hybrids will not be able to be kept as pets and will be dangerous. Furthermore the gestation periods for caracals and domestic cats differ by more than a week meaning that such attempts at cross-breeding would constitute cruelty to animals. 1. Is the Commission aware of these  or other similar  breeding experiments 2. What is the Commissions position on cross-breeding pets with wild animals 3. Does the Commission intend to act to prevent such breeding experiments 4. If so what measures does it intend to take 5. If not why does it not intend to take any measures 6.

2914,A recent study by the US Energy Information Administration an arm of the US Government estimates that Germany sits atop 8 trillion cubic feet 226 billion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas resources. Comparatively this is a low figure when one considers that Norway is estimated to have around 2 350 bcm and Poland 526 bcm. While the discovery of shale gas in North America is in no  to that of the EU unconventional gas is but another source of energy that could be potentially added to the energy mix of any EU Member State. It is worth noting that recent reports insist that ExxonMobil plans to invest at least USD 100million in unconventional gas drilling in North Rhine-Westphalia Germany. Although the discovery of shale gas in North America has attracted interest in Europe various experts have seemed reluctant to support the extraction of shale gas in Europe with one expert from Eurogas stating that its practically impossible  up with a meaningful figure for the gas resources in shale. Despite environmental and other criticisms that oppose the extraction of shale gas in Europe and considering the enormous potential deposits that have been reported to exist does the Commission 1.

2891,The Monte del Pardo is a woodland area located to the north of Madrid city including the entirety of the Monte de ViÊ±uelas. It occupies 26.4 of the surface area of the capital and is considered to be the most important area of Mediterranean forest in the Madrid region and one of the best-preserved in Europe. It is therefore protected by the EU as part of the Natura 2000 network within the Manzanares basin SCI. It is therefore extremely disturbing to find media reports of the piercing of the Monte del Pardo in the form of statements by the Madrid regional governments minister for transport Mr Lamela to the effect that his government intends to dig three tunnels of a length of 32.8 kilometres ten of them in the Monte del Pardo area without undertaking any kind of environmental impact assessment.

3315,An increasing number of reports are appearing in the Greek press about the existence in Greece of large oil deposits which are estimated for example by the newspaper To Paron issue of 19 November 2006 at two billion barrels at a time when daily Greek oil consumption amounts to 400000 barrels. This would mean that the Greek economy could rid itself totally of oil imports over a period of many years while the same newspaper stresses that these deposits are not being revealed by the Greek Government which is continuing the curious tactics of its predecessor and appears unwilling to exploit them so as not to trigger tension with Turkey which maintains a hostile and aggressive stance over the Aegean. The reputed Greek journalist and analyst Mr Kolmer has published a book stating that Greece has huge oil deposits both under the seabed and on land which have been known for decades. The Greek Minister of Development Mr Sioufas recently told the Hellenic Parliament that the Public Electricity Board DEI has faced costs of an additional EUR 300 million since international oil prices began to rise. There is a shortfall of oil in the EU as a whole and its economy is based on oil imports from third countries which results in a huge increase in the costs of European products.

3476,The draft special plan to extend publicly owned land in the Autonomous Region of Valencia for the development of the logistical activities zone ZAL has  a highly controversial issue. Concerned about the erosion of the green belt inconsistencies in the projects and growth forecasts drawn up by the Port Authority of Valencia APV and the scant development of existing port areas numerous environmental bodies residents associations  groups have voiced their opposition by lodging 15  with the Department for Public Works of the Autonomous Region of Valencia. Moreover the project appears to have sidestepped the environmental impact assessment procedure provided for in Council Directive 85/337/EEC1 of 27 June 1985 on the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. Article 2 of the directive stipulates that before consent is given projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue inter alia of their nature size or location are made subject to an assessment with regard to their effects. Were it to go ahead the plan would definitely affect 50 hectares and most likely cover a further 25 hectares. It would have a direct impact on the district of La Punta where land in the green belt continues to face an uncertain future a matter brought to the Commissions attention in Written Question E-0032/982. Furthermore the plan if implemented would involve expropriating private property and forcing people to leave their homes. 1.

360,The trading activities carried on in the port of Motril have for years been undermining the quality of life of local residents. With the stench noise and  vehicle traffic and the transit of goods such as fertilisers cement and fuels which have been increasing every year owing to the fact that the port specialises in the transport of bulk goods. Problems have also arisen from the expansion work to construct a new eastern seawall and raise the western seawall reroute Los Alamos avenue construct a new road and increase the surface area of the port by over 300000 square metres which will envelope the Varadero district which is home to over 1500 people. All these activities have been financed with European funds and have been carried out with a major lack of respect for the environment. Neither the rerouting of the avenue or the construction of the road were subject to any environmental check. The main problem arising from these activities is the creation of a logistical activities zone ZAL designed to house corporate facilities which surrounds the Varadero district with the result that activities such as fuel storage and the loading and unloading of bulk goods mainly cement and phosphates are conducted a matter of metres from peoples homes. No environmental impact assessment was conducted in respect of the facilities that might be located within this ZAL. Similarly no environmental procedure was applied to the framework document port area usage plan regulating the activities to be carried on in the port and no urban planning special plan was conducted to allocate or rectify those activities. All this implies that no assessment was made of the synergies deriving from the ZAL in contravention of Directive 85/337/EEC1 Environmental Impact Assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment as amended by Directive 97/11/EC2.

1567,Given the character of modern armed conflicts the development of intercultural awareness is of increasing importance for Member States armies. Experts stress that cultural factors are hugely important for defence as are intercultural experiences gained on missions. Good intercultural awareness has an impact not only on the success of missions but also on the safety of Member States. Officers should therefore possess cultural knowledge so that operations do not fall apart at the planning stage.

835,A recent study on the implementation of Directive 2001/29/EC drafted by think tank CEPS and presented in the Legal Affairs Committee in the meeting of 16 June 2015 highlights a number of problems arising from the fragmented application of the InfoSoc Directive.

1176,The current value of world imports of ITA Information Technology Agreement goods within ITA countries was approximately USD 1.310 billion in 2009. Expanding the product coverage to include a wider list of consumer electronics and IT products would increase the total value of tariff-free imports by 16.7  to USD 1.529 billion thereby eliminating tariff costs of USD 11.5 billion. Trade costs due to NTBs non-tariff barriers to trade in the IT sector are estimated to exceed USD 124.1 billion a figure which underestimates the total since it is based only on the trade costs of goods covered by the ITA in the EU USA Japan China and Korea. For the ICT services sector NTBs are estimated to be even more significant. Currently the ITA is confined to tariff elimination on IT and electronic products excluding consumer electronics. The main problem is that the ITA does not cover NTBs or ICT services. Therefore it does not address the main concerns of todays IT industry which is characterised by fragmented production chains product convergence as well as convergence between products and services. There is an evident need to address divergent regulations technical standards and multiple testing requirements which involve trade costs.

5,According to Shark Alliance a coalition of more than a hundred research organisations and environmental groups working for the scientifically based conservation of sharks the increase in the fishing effort has led to the severe reduction and in some cases total elimination of shark populations. In particular the cruel practice of finning removing the sharks fins and throwing the carcass back into the sea is responsible for an unsustainable mortality rate and a perilous decline in the shark population. Sharks are particularly vulnerable to intensive fishing and once decimated they have difficulty in recovering. Almost one-third of sharks in EU waters are considered to be at risk according to the criteria of the World Union for Nature Conservation IUCN. The majority of sharks play a vital role in marine ecosystems while overfishing is liable to affect the  and bring about a general alteration in marine habitats. In the EU the fishing of numerous shark species is not regulated while the restrictions on finning are among the worlds least strict with exemptions that make it impossible to apply them fishermen are allowed to unload shark fins and carcasses separately at different times and in different ports. 1. Does the Commission intend to strengthen the existing rules on shark fishing imposing restrictions in line with scientific opinion and on the basis of a precautionary approach 2. Will the Commission take steps to outlaw once and for all the pointless and cruel practice of finning and make it obligatory for sharks to be unloaded with the fins still on the carcass,E-8868/2010,0,According Shark Alliance coalition hundred research organisation environmental group working scientifically based conservation shark increase fishing effort led severe reduction case total elimination shark population In particular cruel practice finning removing shark fin throwing carcass back sea responsible unsustainable mortality rate perilous decline shark population Sharks particularly vulnerable intensive fishing decimated difficulty recovering Almost onethird shark EU water considered risk according criterion World Union Nature Conservation IUCN The majority shark play vital role marine ecosystem overfishing liable affect bring general alteration marine habitat In EU fishing numerous shark specie regulated restriction finning among world least strict exemption make impossible apply fisherman allowed unload shark fin carcass separately different time different port Does Commission intend strengthen existing rule shark fishing imposing restriction line scientific opinion basis precautionary approach Will Commission take step outlaw pointless cruel practice finning make obligatory shark unloaded fin still carcass,EFD,Italy,According to Shark Alliance a coalition of more than a hundred research organisation and environmental group working for the scientifically based conservation of shark the increase in the fishing effort ha led to the severe reduction and in some case total elimination of shark population In particular the cruel practice of finning removing the shark fin and throwing the carcass back into the sea is responsible for an unsustainable mortality rate and a perilous decline in the shark population Sharks are particularly vulnerable to intensive fishing and once decimated they have difficulty in recovering Almost onethird of shark in EU water are considered to be at risk according to the criterion of the World Union for Nature Conservation IUCN The majority of shark play a vital role in marine ecosystem while overfishing is liable to affect the and bring about a general alteration in marine habitat In the EU the fishing of numerous shark specie is not regulated while the restriction on finning are among the world least strict with exemption that make it impossible to apply them fisherman are allowed to unload shark fin and carcass separately at different time and in different port Does the Commission intend to strengthen the existing rule on shark fishing imposing restriction in line with scientific opinion and on the basis of a precautionary approach Will the Commission take step to outlaw once and for all the pointless and cruel practice of finning and make it obligatory for shark to be unloaded with the fin still on the carcass,Oreste Rossi

3498,As a result of deteriorating air quality road traffic in Europe is increasingly being regulated through the introduction of environmental zones. In 2008 Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe entered into force. Individual Member States can now at national regional or local level introduce environmental zones which vehicles can only enter if they have the required emissions sticker. However the growing number of environmental zones in Member States means that drivers are having to buy more and more different emissions stickers to enter the different environmental zones.

697,For efforts to achieve the social reintegration of discharged mental patients to be successful it is necessary to provide specialised care units specifically for this purpose. In many Member States however such units do not exist and as a result patients are transferred from psychiatric non-specialised care units or are returned home without suitable medical supervision. Such a case recently occurred in Greece when a 21-year-old autistic patient was transferred from a psychiatric clinic to a home where he choked to death on his food since the nursing staff were unable to provide him with the necessary care and supervision.

2564,Commercial road haulage is currently affected by a major__ problem. Our hauliers are severely disadvantaged by the current cabotage system which enables a European business__ an international journey to provide domestic transport on a temporary basis within the national territory of another Member State. Furthermore our hauliers are exposed to severe social dumping since the law permits European transport businesses to provide regional national and international transport much more cheaply between countries which are not their own. This__ is a disaster for our hauliers and is pushing many employees and businesses towards joblessness and the brink of collapse. To prevent abuse Regulations EU no 561/2006 and EU no 1072/2009 have allowed a certain number of safeguards to be established. Unfortunately there is no specific document that enables checks to be performed on these journeys and it is very difficult not to say impossible to ensure that__ with these rules. These parasitic journeys put businesses in the host country under enormous pressure. Higher costs mean they are unable to withstand this__ and many have had to either make redundancies or close down. The blatant lack of social and tax harmonisation in Europe is thus subjecting our workers to an intolerable level of social dumping. Abuse is facilitated by the fact that the law currently does not require a vehicle and its crew to return to their home base within a specific time period. Changing the law so as to introduce for example a mandatory return to base every three weeks would enable the current situation to be partially rectified.

1623,Last January the Commission provided an opinion obliging Spains Ministry of Agriculture Food and Environment to bring 22 landfill sites across the country into line with legislation. The Commission requested that the Spanish authorities take the necessary steps to avoid legal proceedings for  with relevant European legislation. The Commission alleged that a number of landfill sites in Spain were in breach of Community legislation and announced it would start a penalty procedure unless the sites took corrective measures. The Retorna Turnaround initiative which involves various ecological associations as well as NGOs like Ecologistas en Acci__n has raised the profile of the fight against these illegal landfills which store over 70 of Spains solid waste by asking the Ministry which ones are failing  with the directive in question.

Out of a total of 49 historical monuments investigated by researchers which are located in low-altitude coastal areas 37 are threatened by a possible great flood especially in the North Adriatic. In addition 42 monuments face an increased risk due to potential coastal erosion such as Pythagoreion and the Heraion in Samos and Tarragona in Spain. By 2100 the risk of flooding in the wider Mediterranean region may have increased by up to 50 and the risk of erosion by 13.

803,On 17 February 2013 the Military Court of Rabat handed down nine life sentences and also sentenced 14 defendants to between 20 and 30 years imprisonment each. Two other defendants were released after serving two-year sentences in pre-trial detention. The convictions relate to violence during and after the Moroccan security forces dismantling of the Gdim Izik protest camp in November 2010 during which operation 11 members of the security forces and two Sahrawis were killed. On 8 November 2010 violence broke out when Moroccan security forces tried to force expulsions and dismantling at the Gdim Izik protest camp near Laayoune in the Western Sahara. The camp was set up in early October that year by Sahrawis protesting against what they describe as their marginalisation and demanding jobs and adequate housing. During and after the violence the security forces arrested some 200 Sahrawis. Up till now and despite persistent calls by Amnesty International and others the Moroccan authorities have taken no action to conduct an independent and impartial investigation into the human rights  in connection with the 2010 events. They have ignored calls to try the defendants in an independent and impartial civilian court. Instead they have opted for a military court from which civilians can never receive a fair trial. It is disturbing that the authorities have also ignored the Sahrawi defendants allegations of torture and forced confessions. The use of military courts and the failure to investigate the allegations of torture cast serious doubt on the Moroccan authorities intentions. A press briefing on the trial prepared by the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expresses concern over the use of a military court to try civilians. It also indicates that as noted by the UN Human Rights Committee the use of military or special courts to try civilians raises serious problems as far as the equitable impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned. 1. Will the Vice-President/High Representative issue a declaration condemning these sentences handed down to civilians by a military court where civilians can never receive a fair trial 2. Will the Vice-President/High Representative request that the Moroccan authorities use civilian courts to give fair retrials to the 25 Sahrawis and that they fully investigate the allegations of torture,P-001852-13,0,On February Military Court Rabat handed nine life sentence also sentenced defendant year imprisonment Two defendant released serving twoyear sentence pretrial detention The conviction relate violence Moroccan security force dismantling Gdim Izik protest camp November operation member security force two Sahrawis killed On November violence broke Moroccan security force tried force expulsion dismantling Gdim Izik protest camp near Laayoune Western Sahara The camp set early October year Sahrawis protesting describe marginalisation demanding job adequate housing During violence security force arrested Sahrawis Up till despite persistent call Amnesty International others Moroccan authority taken action conduct independent impartial investigation human right connection event They ignored call try defendant independent impartial civilian court Instead opted military court civilian never receive fair trial It disturbing authority also ignored Sahrawi defendant allegation torture forced confession The use military court failure investigate allegation torture cast serious doubt Moroccan authority intention A press briefing trial prepared spokesperson UN High Commissioner Human Rights express concern use military court try civilian It also indicates noted UN Human Rights Committee use military special court try civilian raise serious problem far equitable impartial independent administration justice concerned Will VicePresidentHigh Representative issue declaration condemning sentence handed civilian military court civilian never receive fair trial Will VicePresidentHigh Representative request Moroccan authority use civilian court give fair retrial Sahrawis fully investigate allegation torture,Verts/ALE,Spain,On February the Military Court of Rabat handed down nine life sentence and also sentenced defendant to between and year imprisonment each Two other defendant were released after serving twoyear sentence in pretrial detention The conviction relate to violence during and after the Moroccan security force dismantling of the Gdim Izik protest camp in November during which operation member of the security force and two Sahrawis were killed On November violence broke out when Moroccan security force tried to force expulsion and dismantling at the Gdim Izik protest camp near Laayoune in the Western Sahara The camp wa set up in early October that year by Sahrawis protesting against what they describe a their marginalisation and demanding job and adequate housing During and after the violence the security force arrested some Sahrawis Up till now and despite persistent call by Amnesty International and others the Moroccan authority have taken no action to conduct an independent and impartial investigation into the human right in connection with the event They have ignored call to try the defendant in an independent and impartial civilian court Instead they have opted for a military court from which civilian can never receive a fair trial It is disturbing that the authority have also ignored the Sahrawi defendant allegation of torture and forced confession The use of military court and the failure to investigate the allegation of torture cast serious doubt on the Moroccan authority intention A press briefing on the trial prepared by the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights express concern over the use of a military court to try civilian It also indicates that a noted by the UN Human Rights Committee the use of military or special court to try civilian raise serious problem a far a the equitable impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned Will the VicePresidentHigh Representative issue a declaration condemning these sentence handed down to civilian by a military court where civilian can never receive a fair trial Will the VicePresidentHigh Representative request that the Moroccan authority use civilian court to give fair retrial to the Sahrawis and that they fully investigate the allegation of torture,Raül Romeva

3245,Anyone travelling on holiday by car needs  with a large number of rules and regulations some of which differ significantly from the norms in their home country. Road usage charges and the levying of vignette fees tolls and special charges are dealt with by the different Member States in widely different ways. Some countries operate an electronic vignette system while others collect the fees at separate toll booths. This means that holidaymakers find that on top of expensive fuel costs they also need to pay additional fees and that route-specific charges or special tolls may also arise drivers associations and consumer protection agencies issue warnings about this particularly around holiday times. For example from the border between Austria and Italy at ThÊ_rl-Maglern an additional toll of approximately EUR 38 is payable each way on a car journey to Rimini. Driving to Split in Croatia is also an expensive business for the consumer. Last year this journey cost EUR 28. However the charges on this route have now been increased to EUR 30 each way. Likewise the payment arrangements differ greatly as credit cards are not always accepted alongside cash. In France some toll booths require the driver to throw the fee into a basket. However no change is given. Also in some cities such as London charges are payable before entering the city centre while low-emission zones exist in large German cities. I ask the Commission 1. How does it assess the different vignettes and special fees and the different payment arrangements and levy regulations in the various EU Member States 2. In the Commissions opinion how can drivers be protected from unpleasant surprises due to ever-increasing additional charges 3. What is the Commissions view of the different fines imposed in individual EU Member States for toll dodging or driving without a vignette  some of which can be very high  DE C 203 E 17/07/2013,E-006458/2012,0,Anyone travelling holiday car need large number rule regulation differ significantly norm home country Road usage charge levying vignette fee toll special charge dealt different Member States widely different way Some country operate electronic vignette system others collect fee separate toll booth This mean holidaymaker find top expensive fuel cost also need pay additional fee routespecific charge special toll may also arise driver association consumer protection agency issue warning particularly around holiday time For example border Austria Italy Th Ê rlMaglern additional toll approximately EUR payable way car journey Rimini Driving Split Croatia also expensive business consumer Last year journey cost EUR However charge route increased EUR way Likewise payment arrangement differ greatly credit card always accepted alongside cash In France toll booth require driver throw fee basket However change given Also city London charge payable entering city centre lowemission zone exist large German city I ask Commission How ass different vignette special fee different payment arrangement levy regulation various EU Member States In Commissions opinion driver protected unpleasant surprise due everincreasing additional charge What Commissions view different fine imposed individual EU Member States toll dodging driving without vignette high DE C E,NI,Austria,Anyone travelling on holiday by car need with a large number of rule and regulation some of which differ significantly from the norm in their home country Road usage charge and the levying of vignette fee toll and special charge are dealt with by the different Member States in widely different way Some country operate an electronic vignette system while others collect the fee at separate toll booth This mean that holidaymaker find that on top of expensive fuel cost they also need to pay additional fee and that routespecific charge or special toll may also arise driver association and consumer protection agency issue warning about this particularly around holiday time For example from the border between Austria and Italy at Th Ê rlMaglern an additional toll of approximately EUR is payable each way on a car journey to Rimini Driving to Split in Croatia is also an expensive business for the consumer Last year this journey cost EUR However the charge on this route have now been increased to EUR each way Likewise the payment arrangement differ greatly a credit card are not always accepted alongside cash In France some toll booth require the driver to throw the fee into a basket However no change is given Also in some city such a London charge are payable before entering the city centre while lowemission zone exist in large German city I ask the Commission How doe it ass the different vignette and special fee and the different payment arrangement and levy regulation in the various EU Member States In the Commissions opinion how can driver be protected from unpleasant surprise due to everincreasing additional charge What is the Commissions view of the different fine imposed in individual EU Member States for toll dodging or driving without a vignette some of which can be very high DE C E,Franz Obermayr

Members of the Bureau of the Congolese Parliament were bribed to oust the former speaker of parliament. When that did not help other MPs were worked on.

1429,On 31 October 2002 the Molise region was struck by a violent earthquake measuring eight on the Mercalli scale which had its epicentre in the area north-east of Campobasso and was felt throughout the region. Twenty-nine people died as a result of the earthquake and hundreds were injured. In many municipalities there was also serious damage to homes business premises and public facilities.

3297,Tritium is a radioactive material derived from lithium that is manufactured by means of nuclear fission. It is a very expensive material and one that presents certain difficulties with regard to transport which has to be in steel containers and stored at high pressures. In its gaseous form it is also dangerous to human health if inhaled. The fuel used in the ITER reactor is an approximately 50  mixture of deuterium and tritium. At a seminar held in February 2003 at the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory Mohamed Abdou Director of the Fusion Science and Technology Center at the University of California revealed the tritium provisioning problem to be one of the possible limitations of ITER. It would appear that tritium can currently only be obtained from Canadian CANDU type fission reactors even if this material is also manufactured in France. The ITER design anticipates consumption in the order of 1 kg of tritium per year for 16 years some 15-16 kg in total as from 14 years after construction begins and until such time as it is capable of manufacturing it itself. How do the experts working with the Commission propose to provision the ITER experimental reactor with tritium Does the Commission think that it can be provisioned from France itself Furthermore bearing in mind that until now research into better materials has been conducted sporadically and should therefore be carried out more regularly does the Commission have plans to promote more energetically studies on other non-active alloys such as iridium which do not present the transport difficulties or risks to human health that are involved in the use of tritium,E-0984/06,0,Tritium radioactive material derived lithium manufactured mean nuclear fission It expensive material one present certain difficulty regard transport steel container stored high pressure In gaseous form also dangerous human health inhaled The fuel used ITER reactor approximately mixture deuterium tritium At seminar held February MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory Mohamed Abdou Director Fusion Science Technology Center University California revealed tritium provisioning problem one possible limitation ITER It would appear tritium currently obtained Canadian CANDU type fission reactor even material also manufactured France The ITER design anticipates consumption order kg tritium per year year kg total year construction begin time capable manufacturing How expert working Commission propose provision ITER experimental reactor tritium Does Commission think provisioned France Furthermore bearing mind research better material conducted sporadically therefore carried regularly Commission plan promote energetically study nonactive alloy iridium present transport difficulty risk human health involved use tritium,PSE,Spain,Tritium is a radioactive material derived from lithium that is manufactured by mean of nuclear fission It is a very expensive material and one that present certain difficulty with regard to transport which ha to be in steel container and stored at high pressure In it gaseous form it is also dangerous to human health if inhaled The fuel used in the ITER reactor is an approximately mixture of deuterium and tritium At a seminar held in February at the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory Mohamed Abdou Director of the Fusion Science and Technology Center at the University of California revealed the tritium provisioning problem to be one of the possible limitation of ITER It would appear that tritium can currently only be obtained from Canadian CANDU type fission reactor even if this material is also manufactured in France The ITER design anticipates consumption in the order of kg of tritium per year for year some kg in total a from year after construction begin and until such time a it is capable of manufacturing it itself How do the expert working with the Commission propose to provision the ITER experimental reactor with tritium Does the Commission think that it can be provisioned from France itself Furthermore bearing in mind that until now research into better material ha been conducted sporadically and should therefore be carried out more regularly doe the Commission have plan to promote more energetically study on other nonactive alloy such a iridium which do not present the transport difficulty or risk to human health that are involved in the use of tritium,Teresa Riera Madurell

One year on from this declaration of a state of alert conclusions have been drawn by two documents an investigation published by the British Medical Journal which shook public opinion by calling into question the transparency of the findings of the WHO task force on the dangerousness of the virus in question and a report by Mr Paul Flynn MP on the WHOs behaviour in managing the new H1N1 influenza. Mr Flynn declared before the Social Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe that the vaccination programme set up by the WHO was nothing but placebo medicine on a large scale.

1679,The Mont Blanc tunnel between Italy and France has been closed to traffic since 24 March 1999 following a tragic accident inside the tunnel which had terrible consequences. According to recent reports the supposed date for  of the work needed to reopen the tunnel with new safety standards so as to prevent any repetition of serious accidents of this kind is March 2001. This road route with the  of the motorway being built on the Italian side is already included in the trans-European road transport network underlining its importance as a crossing through the Alps. With a view to the reopening of the tunnel and following the wide-ranging debate on the excessive amount of road traffic in the Alpine region fuelled by the tragic consequences of the fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel two different positions have emerged. Some favour a total ban on heavy goods vehicles using the tunnel while others are proposing a strict quota for such vehicles. Furthermore the Valle dAosta autonomous region and the Valais region have decided to relaunch the project to build a rail tunnel between Aosta and Martigny on the rail line from Milan it has been included in the annex to the Italian finance bill for 2000 although it does not form part of the European transport priorities laid down so far.

1181,I have been contacted by a constituent about the case of Shaminder Singh a young boy who apparently was the only practising Sikh in the village of Bagguwal in Nawanshahar district India. My constituent tells me that Shaminder was arrested by police on 31 October 2010 and was mercilessly beaten and subjected to torture for 18 days because he refused to confess to any involvement in violence against the state of India. My constituent explains that Shaminder escaped from police custody on 18 November after he overheard police officers say that he was to be executed but was later arrested in Patna where he revealed that he was a victim of police torture. Apparently a report in the Hindustan Times of 3 December 2010 forced the Punjab and Haryana High Court into action and following an investigation the court ordered the state of Punjab on 3 January 2011 to pay a penalty for Shaminders incarceration and torture and to look after him. My constituent says that on 17 January 2011 Shaminder was attacked by approximately 10 unidentified men with sharp-edged weapons in the village of Bagguwal after which he was admitted to hospital where he died from his injuries several days later.

This is a major reform that will require hard work and massive funding and must be made to succeed for the sake of patients society as a whole and the future of the public health service in Cyprus. I believe that the EU has a duty to support such radical reforms particularly in small countries like Cyprus. Given large amount of funding required EU support for the NHIS will be needed and I believe that the EU should accordingly give priority to such forward-looking initiatives by Member States especially the smaller ones such as Cyprus. In view of this 1. How will the Commission assist Cyprus in this major NHIS undertaking 2. What EU funding programmes can be used to fund the NHIS in Cyprus 3.

363,Corruption tends to play a role in the award of contracts for public sector infrastructure in developing countries. Companies sometimes are reluctant to desist from offering bribes for fear of losing contracts  Corruption could be dealt a serious blow if EU Member States were to agree that certain classes of sales would be subjected to  bidding practices. Under these procedures the World Bank for example could be asked to supervise  bidding for all sales supported by EU export credit and guarantee agencies in certain agreed project categories. The Bank already has in-house expertise in handling such procedures for Bank-funded projects and could develop a fee-based service for export credit agencies. Similar screening arrangements could be envisaged for direct suppliers of equipment and services to public sector projects. In the interest of good governance  and the fight against international crime will the Commission explore the is idea - supported by the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs - with the EU Member States,E-0619/98,0,Corruption tends play role award contract public sector infrastructure developing country Companies sometimes reluctant desist offering bribe fear losing contract Corruption could dealt serious blow EU Member States agree certain class sale would subjected bidding practice Under procedure World Bank example could asked supervise bidding sale supported EU export credit guarantee agency certain agreed project category The Bank already inhouse expertise handling procedure Bankfunded project could develop feebased service export credit agency Similar screening arrangement could envisaged direct supplier equipment service public sector project In interest good governance fight international crime Commission explore idea supported Intergovernmental Group TwentyFour International Monetary Affairs EU Member States,ELDR,Netherlands,Corruption tends to play a role in the award of contract for public sector infrastructure in developing country Companies sometimes are reluctant to desist from offering bribe for fear of losing contract Corruption could be dealt a serious blow if EU Member States were to agree that certain class of sale would be subjected to bidding practice Under these procedure the World Bank for example could be asked to supervise bidding for all sale supported by EU export credit and guarantee agency in certain agreed project category The Bank already ha inhouse expertise in handling such procedure for Bankfunded project and could develop a feebased service for export credit agency Similar screening arrangement could be envisaged for direct supplier of equipment and service to public sector project In the interest of good governance and the fight against international crime will the Commission explore the is idea supported by the Intergovernmental Group of TwentyFour on International Monetary Affairs with the EU Member States,Gijs de Vries
381,According to a new study published by the National Academy of Sciences a growing percentage of emission levels for which the industrialised economies are responsible are actually caused by the production of goods and services in developing countries. In this way a number of countries have managed to conceal their increased carbon footprint. This can be explained by the fact that emissions from manufacturing processes are attributed to the country of manufacture while remaining invisible in the country of consumption. In other words the official emission levels of certain consuming countries remain unchanged their increased carbon footprint occurring in other countries where the goods consumed are being manufactured. Increased imports by wealthy countries have in fact led to increased production and  emission levels in the developing countries. According to the Oslo Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in 2008 alone the increase in emissions from developing countries attributable to consumption by the industrialised countries was five times the CO2 reduction achieved by the latter. In view of this does the Commission intend to encourage the introduction of more effective methods of monitoring production in developing countries for the benefit of industrialised countries,E-004620/2011,0,According new study published National Academy Sciences growing percentage emission level industrialised economy responsible actually caused production good service developing country In way number country managed conceal increased carbon footprint This explained fact emission manufacturing process attributed country manufacture remaining invisible country consumption In word official emission level certain consuming country remain unchanged increased carbon footprint occurring country good consumed manufactured Increased import wealthy country fact led increased production emission level developing country According Oslo Centre International Climate Environmental Research alone increase emission developing country attributable consumption industrialised country five time CO reduction achieved latter In view Commission intend encourage introduction effective method monitoring production developing country benefit industrialised country,EFD,Italy,According to a new study published by the National Academy of Sciences a growing percentage of emission level for which the industrialised economy are responsible are actually caused by the production of good and service in developing country In this way a number of country have managed to conceal their increased carbon footprint This can be explained by the fact that emission from manufacturing process are attributed to the country of manufacture while remaining invisible in the country of consumption In other word the official emission level of certain consuming country remain unchanged their increased carbon footprint occurring in other country where the good consumed are being manufactured Increased import by wealthy country have in fact led to increased production and emission level in the developing country According to the Oslo Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in alone the increase in emission from developing country attributable to consumption by the industrialised country wa five time the CO reduction achieved by the latter In view of this doe the Commission intend to encourage the introduction of more effective method of monitoring production in developing country for the benefit of industrialised country,Oreste Rossi
3409,The Safer Internet programme is designed to promote safe use of the Internet and it constitutes a response to the problem of illegal and harmful Internet content without undermining freedom of speech. The child safety mobile phone project constitutes a response to the same problem as regards the safe use of mobile telephones particularly where children are concerned. It is after all the case that a single click can provide access to the tens of thousands of hard-porn photos or videos which are now available via a mobile telephone. The opportunities created by new technologies in the child-pornography sector were unimaginable just a few years ago. Historically every civilisation has carefully instructed its young regarding the delicate relationship between love and sex. We moderns however have left that task to Internet pornography speculators and we are not even capable of realising the deplorable effects which this may have. Hence the attempt to stem the swirling tide of images of this nature in order to protect youngsters is laudable. On the market there are now technologies such as the one known as differentiated web surfing which are designed to achieve just such an objective by placing responsibility in the hands of parents and enabling them to identify sources of pornography whilst at the same time allowing the providers of such material to determine whether or not consumers thereof are under age. This is extremely important since supplying unsuitable material to minors constitutes a criminal offence on the part of the supplier. The technology which performs this function in the case of mobile telephones is called differentiated SIM. 1. Is the Commission aware of the above technologies 2. Would the Commission be willing to use those technologies in its initiatives to promote safe use of the Internet by minors 3. Would the Commission do the same in order to ensure that mobile telephones can be safely used by children 4. Just as a single telephone number 116000 has been introduced throughout Europe in order to help those seeking information concerning missing children would it not be possible for a single dialling code to be introduced throughout Europe for mobile telephones used by children in order to enable content providers to identify this particular category of users and in order to make them aware that any illegal activities on their part can be detected,E-5833/06,0,The Safer Internet programme designed promote safe use Internet constitutes response problem illegal harmful Internet content without undermining freedom speech The child safety mobile phone project constitutes response problem regard safe use mobile telephone particularly child concerned It case single click provide access ten thousand hardporn photo video available via mobile telephone The opportunity created new technology childpornography sector unimaginable year ago Historically every civilisation carefully instructed young regarding delicate relationship love sex We modern however left task Internet pornography speculator even capable realising deplorable effect may Hence attempt stem swirling tide image nature order protect youngster laudable On market technology one known differentiated web surfing designed achieve objective placing responsibility hand parent enabling identify source pornography whilst time allowing provider material determine whether consumer thereof age This extremely important since supplying unsuitable material minor constitutes criminal offence part supplier The technology performs function case mobile telephone called differentiated SIM Is Commission aware technology Would Commission willing use technology initiative promote safe use Internet minor Would Commission order ensure mobile telephone safely used child Just single telephone number introduced throughout Europe order help seeking information concerning missing child would possible single dialling code introduced throughout Europe mobile telephone used child order enable content provider identify particular category user order make aware illegal activity part detected,UEN,Italy,The Safer Internet programme is designed to promote safe use of the Internet and it constitutes a response to the problem of illegal and harmful Internet content without undermining freedom of speech The child safety mobile phone project constitutes a response to the same problem a regard the safe use of mobile telephone particularly where child are concerned It is after all the case that a single click can provide access to the ten of thousand of hardporn photo or video which are now available via a mobile telephone The opportunity created by new technology in the childpornography sector were unimaginable just a few year ago Historically every civilisation ha carefully instructed it young regarding the delicate relationship between love and sex We modern however have left that task to Internet pornography speculator and we are not even capable of realising the deplorable effect which this may have Hence the attempt to stem the swirling tide of image of this nature in order to protect youngster is laudable On the market there are now technology such a the one known a differentiated web surfing which are designed to achieve just such an objective by placing responsibility in the hand of parent and enabling them to identify source of pornography whilst at the same time allowing the provider of such material to determine whether or not consumer thereof are under age This is extremely important since supplying unsuitable material to minor constitutes a criminal offence on the part of the supplier The technology which performs this function in the case of mobile telephone is called differentiated SIM Is the Commission aware of the above technology Would the Commission be willing to use those technology in it initiative to promote safe use of the Internet by minor Would the Commission do the same in order to ensure that mobile telephone can be safely used by child Just a a single telephone number ha been introduced throughout Europe in order to help those seeking information concerning missing child would it not be possible for a single dialling code to be introduced throughout Europe for mobile telephone used by child in order to enable content provider to identify this particular category of user and in order to make them aware that any illegal activity on their part can be detected,Cristiana Muscardini

1985,According to Article 6 of the FFH Directive 92/43/EEC1 any plan or project that is likely to have a significant effect on a special area of conservation must be assessed for its implications for the site in view of the sites conservation objectives. In the light of the assessment of the implications for the site  authorities may agree to the plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned and if appropriate after having obtained the opinion of the general public. In Austria Article 6 of the FFH Directive was transposed into nine provincial laws on nature conservation. However eight of these new provincial laws stipulate that the opinion of the general public must be obtained. The authorities are not able therefore to decide for themselves according to each individual case whether or not to obtain the opinion of the general public. 1. Under what circumstances does Commission believe that the national authorities should obtain the opinion of the general public when assessing the implications for a site in accordance with Article 6 of the FFH Directive 2.

2910,The US Government has confirmed that a group linked to Al-Qaeda known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group LIFG took part in the capture of Tripoli in late August. The group in question is led by Adb al-Hakim Belhadj a former Taliban fighter who was arrested by the CIA in 2003 and later extradited to Libya where he was sentenced to prison. Strategic analysis institutes say that it is currently impossible to rule out the possibility that the LIFG might have sufficient resources to withstand the leadership of the National Transitional Council and that it might be able to take control of Tripoli and of Libya itself. The same institutes also point out that Libya still has weapons of mass destruction including 10 tonnes of mustard gas and nuclear material that could fall into the hands of the jihadist group in question. Furthermore the abovementioned studies concluded that the entire NATO operation in Libya had significantly underestimated Gaddafis warnings relating to Al-Qaedas ability to divert the Libyan rebels revolt for their own ends and thus to gradually take control of Libya. Is the Commission aware of these developments Does it believe that the LIFG has sufficient resources to take control of the other factions in Libya If so does it think that in the near future Libya could__ Talibanised as Afghanistan did following the withdrawal of Soviet troops Does it not agree that these developments pose a serious threat to the immediate security of the EU Furthermore does the Commission believe that the cooperation on terrorism between the EU and North African countries launched by the Barcelona process is sufficient to counter that threat Should these measures prove to be insufficient what further steps will the Commission take to address this new security emergency,E-008388/2011,0,The US Government confirmed group linked AlQaeda known Libyan Islamic Fighting Group LIFG took part capture Tripoli late August The group question led Adb alHakim Belhadj former Taliban fighter arrested CIA later extradited Libya sentenced prison Strategic analysis institute say currently impossible rule possibility LIFG might sufficient resource withstand leadership National Transitional Council might able take control Tripoli Libya The institute also point Libya still weapon mass destruction including tonne mustard gas nuclear material could fall hand jihadist group question Furthermore abovementioned study concluded entire NATO operation Libya significantly underestimated Gaddafis warning relating AlQaedas ability divert Libyan rebel revolt end thus gradually take control Libya Is Commission aware development Does believe LIFG sufficient resource take control faction Libya If think near future Libya could Talibanised Afghanistan following withdrawal Soviet troop Does agree development pose serious threat immediate security EU Furthermore Commission believe cooperation terrorism EU North African country launched Barcelona process sufficient counter threat Should measure prove insufficient step Commission take address new security emergency,EFD,Italy,The US Government ha confirmed that a group linked to AlQaeda known a the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group LIFG took part in the capture of Tripoli in late August The group in question is led by Adb alHakim Belhadj a former Taliban fighter who wa arrested by the CIA in and later extradited to Libya where he wa sentenced to prison Strategic analysis institute say that it is currently impossible to rule out the possibility that the LIFG might have sufficient resource to withstand the leadership of the National Transitional Council and that it might be able to take control of Tripoli and of Libya itself The same institute also point out that Libya still ha weapon of mass destruction including tonne of mustard gas and nuclear material that could fall into the hand of the jihadist group in question Furthermore the abovementioned study concluded that the entire NATO operation in Libya had significantly underestimated Gaddafis warning relating to AlQaedas ability to divert the Libyan rebel revolt for their own end and thus to gradually take control of Libya Is the Commission aware of these development Does it believe that the LIFG ha sufficient resource to take control of the other faction in Libya If so doe it think that in the near future Libya could Talibanised a Afghanistan did following the withdrawal of Soviet troop Does it not agree that these development pose a serious threat to the immediate security of the EU Furthermore doe the Commission believe that the cooperation on terrorism between the EU and North African country launched by the Barcelona process is sufficient to counter that threat Should these measure prove to be insufficient what further step will the Commission take to address this new security emergency,Mara Bizzotto

1908,The registering of medical-veterinary products medicines immunological medicinal products vaccines disinfectants etc. used in aquaculture is currently the prerogative of the governments of the EUs various Member States. In Portugal the number of medical veterinary products registered is very small because the registration process itself is rather slow and expensive. Given the low turnover which the size of the Portuguese market potentially represents the pharmaceutical industries do not wish to shoulder the burden of the studies and licences involved in the registration process the same goes for other EU countries where the market for aquacultural products is small. This means that in those countries including Portugal fishfarmers do not have the same ease of access to certain pharmaceutical products used in aquaculture this represents an undeniably__ disadvantage in terms of final price and the hygiene and health management of production units. This being so and given that the EU is also a market in which products and goods enjoy freedom of movement 1.

1952,The world crisis of the last few years and falling profit margins in the banking sector have led financial institutions to adopt a more and more aggressive policy in the insurance mediation sector with a view to increasing profits in the shape of an all-out attempt to sell insurance policies to anyone requiring funds or any other service which is the exclusive preserve of the banks. In Spain various techniques and strategies are being used to achieve this frequently in possible infringement of legislation on the protection of personal data freedom  and consumers rights. The most widespread technique is to make the granting of loans conditional on the consumers agreeing to take out one or more insurance policies with the bancassurance operator linked to the bank or savings bank in question if the consumer does not do so the conditions attached to the loan may be less favourable or the finance being sought may indeed not be granted if the consumer refuses to take out policies with the banks. Could there at least be a requirement that if an insurance policy is taken out to strengthen a loan it is absolutely forbidden that the intermediary be a body linked to the bank granting the loan in question,E-004148/2011,0,The world crisis last year falling profit margin banking sector led financial institution adopt aggressive policy insurance mediation sector view increasing profit shape allout attempt sell insurance policy anyone requiring fund service exclusive preserve bank In Spain various technique strategy used achieve frequently possible infringement legislation protection personal data freedom consumer right The widespread technique make granting loan conditional consumer agreeing take one insurance policy bancassurance operator linked bank saving bank question consumer condition attached loan may le favourable finance sought may indeed granted consumer refuse take policy bank Could least requirement insurance policy taken strengthen loan absolutely forbidden intermediary body linked bank granting loan question,ALDE,Spain,The world crisis of the last few year and falling profit margin in the banking sector have led financial institution to adopt a more and more aggressive policy in the insurance mediation sector with a view to increasing profit in the shape of an allout attempt to sell insurance policy to anyone requiring fund or any other service which is the exclusive preserve of the bank In Spain various technique and strategy are being used to achieve this frequently in possible infringement of legislation on the protection of personal data freedom and consumer right The most widespread technique is to make the granting of loan conditional on the consumer agreeing to take out one or more insurance policy with the bancassurance operator linked to the bank or saving bank in question if the consumer doe not do so the condition attached to the loan may be le favourable or the finance being sought may indeed not be granted if the consumer refuse to take out policy with the bank Could there at least be a requirement that if an insurance policy is taken out to strengthen a loan it is absolutely forbidden that the intermediary be a body linked to the bank granting the loan in question,Ramon Tremosa

1007,Early this year on behalf of many concerned London constituents I asked the Commission about the anti-dumping duties ADD imposed on ceramic tableware and kitchenware currently being imported into the EU from China. I specifically asked the Commission whether it had considered the severe financial consequences that a large increase in duties would have for some of the EUs small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs should a proposed increase of 60-70  based on recent ADD increases for candles and tiles go ahead. On 27 April 2012 the Commission responded to my question and informed me that if any definitive measures were to be taken they would have to be imposed by 15 May 2013. I was also told that Commission findings in anti-dumping investigation are the results of a proper and impartial investigation to which all interested parties can contribute. However in recent days numerous SMEs operating in my constituency of London have informed me that they have suddenly and without warning been given notice that they now have to pay an arbitrary 58.8  duty on Chinese porcelain shipments entering the EU instead of the 12  duty they have been paying until now. Given these circumstances could the Commission please answer the following questions 1. Would it not agree that this sudden increase in the duty to be paid is very disconcerting for EU SMEs operating in this sector 2. Would it not agree that SME importers wholesalers and retailers have not been informed and that their situation which it acknowledges to be part of the Union interest analysis has not been taken into consideration in an adequate manner 3. Can the Commission explain why the duty has been increased excessively according to my constituents from 12  to 58.8  4.

2106,EU citizens who are subject to Swiss health insurance are facing an additional surcharge. The main victims of this practice are German workers from the border area who work in Switzerland. German workers working in Switzerland face the burden of surcharges for EU citizens in addition to contributions to the Swiss health insurance system which are in any case higher than those in Germany. As a result many German workers are finding themselves forced to move to Switzerland so that German localities in the border area are suffering large-scale migration to Switzerland with all the negative effects that this has. This practice is a breach of the agreement on freedom of movement signed between the European Union and Switzerland. Consequently the questions indicated below arise. 1. Does the Commission consider that the situation described constitutes discrimination against EU citizens 2. Is the Commission considering taking action in this case and making  with the provisions of the agreement on freedom of movement 3.

780,Bulgarian and European citizens organisations have drawn my attention to the issue of foie gras production. The main controversy around foie gras production is the use of force-feeding during which a tube is inserted into the birds throat in order to pump large quantities of food into their bodies much more than they would voluntarily ingest. As a result of this practice the animals liver can grow to more than 10 times its normal size. The process of force-feeding causes the birds severe health problems and this is a sign that current legislation is not effective in safeguarding the welfare of animals used for foie gras production. In its answer to Written Question E-000034-15 the Commission announced revised standards in principle planned to be adopted in 2016. Subsequently an external evaluation of many marketing standards was announced which could end up being too close to the end of the Commissions mandate to act.

In the Netherlands smoking is prohibited at workplaces and therefore also in restaurants cafÊ©s and discotheques. The smoking ban came into force in the Netherlands on 1 July 2008 and is currently highly controversial. Many cafÊ© owners in the Netherlands have started providing ashtrays once again on the grounds that a substantial drop in sales is threatening to force many of them out of business. The ban is difficult to enforce because the people breaching it far outnumber the inspectors responsible for  with it. 1. Is the Commission aware of the pressing problems which the ban on smoking is causing in the Netherlands and other Member States If not why not 2. In its answer to my earlier questions concerning the ban on smoking1 the Commission stated that in 2008 an impact assessment would be carried out concerning the cost-effectiveness of the various possible ways of reducing the effects of passive smoking. When will the results of that impact assessment be available 3. Would the Commission consider introducing instead of a blanket ban on smoking at workplaces a universal right to clean air based on existing European law on limit values for particles in the air in keeping with which the owner of a building would be responsible for ensuring that the law  with and would be free to choose how to provide clean air If so why If not why not,E-6436/08,0,Last month Commissioner pidla announced considering imposing blanket ban smoking workplace EU Not Member States yet imposed ban differing approach taken smoking ban European Union In Netherlands smoking prohibited workplace therefore also restaurant caf Ê discotheque The smoking ban came force Netherlands July currently highly controversial Many caf Ê owner Netherlands started providing ashtray ground substantial drop sale threatening force many business The ban difficult enforce people breaching far outnumber inspector responsible Is Commission aware pressing problem ban smoking causing Netherlands Member States If In answer earlier question concerning ban smoking Commission stated impact assessment would carried concerning costeffectiveness various possible way reducing effect passive smoking When result impact assessment available Would Commission consider introducing instead blanket ban smoking workplace universal right clean air based existing European law limit value particle air keeping owner building would responsible ensuring law would free choose provide clean air If If,ALDE,Netherlands,Last month Commissioner pidla announced that he wa considering imposing a blanket ban on smoking at workplace in the EU Not all Member States have yet imposed such a ban and differing approach are being taken to smoking ban in the European Union In the Netherlands smoking is prohibited at workplace and therefore also in restaurant caf Ê s and discotheque The smoking ban came into force in the Netherlands on July and is currently highly controversial Many caf Ê owner in the Netherlands have started providing ashtray once again on the ground that a substantial drop in sale is threatening to force many of them out of business The ban is difficult to enforce because the people breaching it far outnumber the inspector responsible for with it Is the Commission aware of the pressing problem which the ban on smoking is causing in the Netherlands and other Member States If not why not In it answer to my earlier question concerning the ban on smoking the Commission stated that in an impact assessment would be carried out concerning the costeffectiveness of the various possible way of reducing the effect of passive smoking When will the result of that impact assessment be available Would the Commission consider introducing instead of a blanket ban on smoking at workplace a universal right to clean air based on existing European law on limit value for particle in the air in keeping with which the owner of a building would be responsible for ensuring that the law with and would be free to choose how to provide clean air If so why If not why not,Toine Manders

2421,In response to my previous question regarding Cypriot property title deeds E006305/2013 Commissioner Rehn stated that The MoU memorandum of understanding therefore envisages a specific deadline for the elimination of the observed backlog. The swift clearing of encumbrances on title deed transfers constitutes an important element of this agreement. Is the Commission aware that receivers acting for banks are currently threatening buyers with selling their homes unless the buyers pay off the developers defaulted mortgages their taxes and other creditors In the case of the now defunct Liasides developer involving 230 properties Alpha Banks receivers are informing the buyers that unless they pay off the developers mortgages and taxes on their homes the properties will be sold. Due to the level of debt there will be no surplus funds  the buyers who will then be homeless. Mortgages which go back to 2002 in some cases have not been serviced during this period yet Alpha Bank has taken no remedial action and these now stand at several times the initial mortgage advanced. Receivers fees at 11 of the purchase price are also payable by the buyers. Most of these properties are illegal due to the lack of building permits  certificates yet it is envisaged that the individual title deeds should be transferred to buyers through the courts. Moreover the deeds will still be encumbered by the many other claims against the developer as a result of creditor court judgments. Could the Commission please confirm that this extortion by the banks and their receivers is in direct conflict with the terms of the MoU,E-012350-13,0,In response previous question regarding Cypriot property title deed E Commissioner Rehn stated The MoU memorandum understanding therefore envisages specific deadline elimination observed backlog The swift clearing encumbrance title deed transfer constitutes important element agreement Is Commission aware receiver acting bank currently threatening buyer selling home unless buyer pay developer defaulted mortgage tax creditor In case defunct Liasides developer involving property Alpha Banks receiver informing buyer unless pay developer mortgage tax home property sold Due level debt surplus fund buyer homeless Mortgages go back case serviced period yet Alpha Bank taken remedial action stand several time initial mortgage advanced Receivers fee purchase price also payable buyer Most property illegal due lack building permit certificate yet envisaged individual title deed transferred buyer court Moreover deed still encumbered many claim developer result creditor court judgment Could Commission please confirm extortion bank receiver direct conflict term MoU,ECR,United Kingdom,In response to my previous question regarding Cypriot property title deed E Commissioner Rehn stated that The MoU memorandum of understanding therefore envisages a specific deadline for the elimination of the observed backlog The swift clearing of encumbrance on title deed transfer constitutes an important element of this agreement Is the Commission aware that receiver acting for bank are currently threatening buyer with selling their home unless the buyer pay off the developer defaulted mortgage their tax and other creditor In the case of the now defunct Liasides developer involving property Alpha Banks receiver are informing the buyer that unless they pay off the developer mortgage and tax on their home the property will be sold Due to the level of debt there will be no surplus fund the buyer who will then be homeless Mortgages which go back to in some case have not been serviced during this period yet Alpha Bank ha taken no remedial action and these now stand at several time the initial mortgage advanced Receivers fee at of the purchase price are also payable by the buyer Most of these property are illegal due to the lack of building permit certificate yet it is envisaged that the individual title deed should be transferred to buyer through the court Moreover the deed will still be encumbered by the many other claim against the developer a a result of creditor court judgment Could the Commission please confirm that this extortion by the bank and their receiver is in direct conflict with the term of the MoU,Daniel Hannan

3370,A team of scientists from the Laboratory for Bioacoustic Applications LAB at the Polytechnic University of Catalunya led by Professor Michel Andre has drawn up an underwater acoustic map of the Catalan coast showing the levels of underwater noise caused by maritime traffic throughout the year see www.lab.upc.es/mapa. The study is based on the fact that human activity in the past century has increased to such an extent that noise pollution has  a threat to the marine equilibrium from maritime transport to the exploitation and production of gas and oil via military and industrial sonar experimental sources of noise underwater explosive charges and supersonic aircraft. The results of this study show that the ports of Barcelona and Tarragona are the areas with the highest level of noise pollution reaching peaks of 190 decibels which may cause pain in cetaceans passing through nearby waters and interfere with the frequencies they use to navigate  with other animals of the same species. Indirectly noise also affects the rest of the food chain. The worst affected are the striped dolphin which lives along the Costa Brava and the bottle-nose dolphin which is frequently found in the Ebro Delta. There are plans to expand the report with research along the remainder of the Spanish coast in 2009. The scientists responsible for the study propose measures such as soundproofing for vessel engines and creating appropriate shipping lanes. Is the Commission aware of the worrying effects of noise pollution on the marine environment Does the Commission have any similar studies on other stretches of the European Unions coastline If not will it request or encourage such studies To what extent did the Commission take these facts into account when drawing up its marine strategy and how will it adapt that strategy to the results of research such as that undertaken by the Polytechnic University of Barcelona,E-0191/08,0,A team scientist Laboratory Bioacoustic Applications LAB Polytechnic University Catalunya led Professor Michel Andre drawn underwater acoustic map Catalan coast showing level underwater noise caused maritime traffic throughout year see wwwlabupcesmapa The study based fact human activity past century increased extent noise pollution threat marine equilibrium maritime transport exploitation production gas oil via military industrial sonar experimental source noise underwater explosive charge supersonic aircraft The result study show port Barcelona Tarragona area highest level noise pollution reaching peak decibel may cause pain cetacean passing nearby water interfere frequency use navigate animal specie Indirectly noise also affect rest food chain The worst affected striped dolphin life along Costa Brava bottlenose dolphin frequently found Ebro Delta There plan expand report research along remainder Spanish coast The scientist responsible study propose measure soundproofing vessel engine creating appropriate shipping lane Is Commission aware worrying effect noise pollution marine environment Does Commission similar study stretch European Unions coastline If request encourage study To extent Commission take fact account drawing marine strategy adapt strategy result research undertaken Polytechnic University Barcelona,Verts/ALE,Spain,A team of scientist from the Laboratory for Bioacoustic Applications LAB at the Polytechnic University of Catalunya led by Professor Michel Andre ha drawn up an underwater acoustic map of the Catalan coast showing the level of underwater noise caused by maritime traffic throughout the year see wwwlabupcesmapa The study is based on the fact that human activity in the past century ha increased to such an extent that noise pollution ha a threat to the marine equilibrium from maritime transport to the exploitation and production of gas and oil via military and industrial sonar experimental source of noise underwater explosive charge and supersonic aircraft The result of this study show that the port of Barcelona and Tarragona are the area with the highest level of noise pollution reaching peak of decibel which may cause pain in cetacean passing through nearby water and interfere with the frequency they use to navigate with other animal of the same specie Indirectly noise also affect the rest of the food chain The worst affected are the striped dolphin which life along the Costa Brava and the bottlenose dolphin which is frequently found in the Ebro Delta There are plan to expand the report with research along the remainder of the Spanish coast in The scientist responsible for the study propose measure such a soundproofing for vessel engine and creating appropriate shipping lane Is the Commission aware of the worrying effect of noise pollution on the marine environment Does the Commission have any similar study on other stretch of the European Unions coastline If not will it request or encourage such study To what extent did the Commission take these fact into account when drawing up it marine strategy and how will it adapt that strategy to the result of research such a that undertaken by the Polytechnic University of Barcelona,Raül Romeva

However there are some concerns about this agreement particularly from the point of view of EU agriculture.

1156,It is well-known that in virtually all EU countries the volunteer fire brigade is the driving force and chief representative of civil protection with each State fully meeting its obligations to ensure that the volunteer fire brigade carries out its duties safely to protect them but also to support the institution of voluntary work generally. The institution of the Volunteer Fire Brigade was established in Greece in 1991 by Law No 1951/91 and Presidential Decree 32/92 which allow citizens to perform voluntary unpaid work in the Fire-Rescue sector but exclusively as part of the operational actions of the fire brigade.

536,Members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic submitted a draft amendment to the law on the production and marketing of alcohol and the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to allow the private production of distillates containing less than 86 by volume of ethyl alcohol in a volume of not more than 25 litres and only if it is intended exclusively for the personal consumption of the private producer of the distillate. The production of the distillate has to be done using certified equipment with a volume of no more than 100 litres and designed for the production of spirits in the private producers place of residence or in the place where the producer owns or rents a fruit garden and the producer must use only fruit or derivatives of fruit that they have personally cultivated. Producers must be at least 18 years of age but they do not have to meet any other requirements e.g. a certain level of education. According to the proposal the distillate produced may not be given to others for payment and may not be placed on the market. Under the proposal alcohol made by private producers would be subject to just 50 of the excise duty rate for alcoholic beverages. Would the adoption of this national law be at odds with EC law If so to what extent Might the wording be in breach of the ECJ judgment in Case C-115/13,P-003926-18,0,Members National Council Slovak Republic submitted draft amendment law production marketing alcohol law excise duty alcoholic beverage The purpose proposed amendment allow private production distillate containing le volume ethyl alcohol volume litre intended exclusively personal consumption private producer distillate The production distillate done using certified equipment volume litre designed production spirit private producer place residence place producer owns rent fruit garden producer must use fruit derivative fruit personally cultivated Producers must least year age meet requirement eg certain level education According proposal distillate produced may given others payment may placed market Under proposal alcohol made private producer would subject excise duty rate alcoholic beverage Would adoption national law odds EC law If extent Might wording breach ECJ judgment Case C,ECR,Slovakia,Members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic submitted a draft amendment to the law on the production and marketing of alcohol and the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverage The purpose of the proposed amendment is to allow the private production of distillate containing le than by volume of ethyl alcohol in a volume of not more than litre and only if it is intended exclusively for the personal consumption of the private producer of the distillate The production of the distillate ha to be done using certified equipment with a volume of no more than litre and designed for the production of spirit in the private producer place of residence or in the place where the producer owns or rent a fruit garden and the producer must use only fruit or derivative of fruit that they have personally cultivated Producers must be at least year of age but they do not have to meet any other requirement eg a certain level of education According to the proposal the distillate produced may not be given to others for payment and may not be placed on the market Under the proposal alcohol made by private producer would be subject to just of the excise duty rate for alcoholic beverage Would the adoption of this national law be at odds with EC law If so to what extent Might the wording be in breach of the ECJ judgment in Case C,Richard Sulík
