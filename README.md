# Quantitative Text Analysis and the European Union

Parliamentary questions are one of the key means of oversight in the European Union. This project aims to analyze the ways that this oversight process is used at the European level through large scale, quantitative text analysis, machine learning, and statistical methods as well as finalize the data structure for a large N, text dataset that will be made publicly available at the conclusion of the research. 

This project is led by Matthew Stenberg, PhD in Political Science at Berkeley, supervised by Professor Christopher Ansell from UC Berkeley Department of Political Science. It consists of 3 subprojects: Parsing, Merging, and Machine Learning. I started from Subproject 2: Merging, and transitioned to Subproject 3: Machine Learning the following semester. You can find my code in each project in their corresponding folder.

(Note: This is not the official repository for the research group. Rather, it's my personal repository that records my contributions to the project.)
