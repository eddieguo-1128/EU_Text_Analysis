3153,After weeks of protests by opponents of the Stuttgart 21 railway station project that is being pursued as part of the Trans-European Transport Network TENT mediation talks have finally taken place between opponents and advocates of the project. In the mediation ruling it was clearly noted that there was a wide discrepancy between the planning and the implementation of major projects like Stuttgart 21. Several decades often elapse between planning and implementation with the result that costs have increased by the time the project is implemented cost increases that were unforeseeable when the project was launched so many years before. What scope does the Commission see for accelerating the implementation of major TEN projects so as to reduce the time lag between planning and implementation and thus avoid rising costs Has the Commission already taken specific measures that can prevent such time lapses between the planning and implementation of major projects,E-011236/2011,0,After week protest opponent Stuttgart railway station project pursued part TransEuropean Transport Network TENT mediation talk finally taken place opponent advocate project In mediation ruling clearly noted wide discrepancy planning implementation major project like Stuttgart Several decade often elapse planning implementation result cost increased time project implemented cost increase unforeseeable project launched many year What scope Commission see accelerating implementation major TEN project reduce time lag planning implementation thus avoid rising cost Has Commission already taken specific measure prevent time lapse planning implementation major project,NI,Austria,After week of protest by opponent of the Stuttgart railway station project that is being pursued a part of the TransEuropean Transport Network TENT mediation talk have finally taken place between opponent and advocate of the project In the mediation ruling it wa clearly noted that there wa a wide discrepancy between the planning and the implementation of major project like Stuttgart Several decade often elapse between planning and implementation with the result that cost have increased by the time the project is implemented cost increase that were unforeseeable when the project wa launched so many year before What scope doe the Commission see for accelerating the implementation of major TEN project so a to reduce the time lag between planning and implementation and thus avoid rising cost Has the Commission already taken specific measure that can prevent such time lapse between the planning and implementation of major project,Hans-Peter Martin

1164,1. Is the Commission aware that newborn children of Palestinian residents of Jerusalem whom their parents register for inclusion in the city population register are not entered in that register so that they are officially not residents and therefore for example have no right to healthcare and that this refusal is probably intended to place the families concerned under pressure to leave the city permanently and settle in areas which Israel regards as potential territory for a future Palestinian State 2.

3252,There has been much discussion lately in Finland concerning cooling-off periods for politicians and senior civil servants. Cooling-off period refers to the time which should elapse before a person who has held a public service position may move to a job in the same sector in the business world or into the service of a professional body. The possibility of conflicts of interest in transfer situations is particularly great if there is no cooling-off period. In such situations the new employer immediately gets hold of information which is of significant use to it in its business activities. Such information may for example relate to the central activities strategies and short-term plans of its public sector counterpart. Cooling-off periods fall within the  of the Member States. In the light of the above 1.

2318,If my information is correct an individual who changes from auxiliary status to the newlycreated status of contract staff suffers certain disadvantages in particular a 30  reduction in pay nonrecognition of studies nonrecognition of tasks actually carried out and nonrecognition of experience acquired including within the institution. The contracts in question remain fixedterm contracts  of 18 months  although many individuals have enjoyed a succession of fixedterm contracts over more than two years. Subsequently a selection procedure will be carried out in the form of an  for a possible extension of five years.

Monitoring the application of the directive is clearly the task of each Member State of the European Union but if a Member State does not carry out the relevant checks this constitutes unequal treatment of the public owing to a lack of due transparency of information and the fact that people cannot gain access to information and take part in decision-making processes.

1171,In some European countries consumers organisations have joined forces to campaign against additional charges which are imposed over and above published air fares. The practice of making such charges is contrary to the rules on consumer protection Regulation EC No 1008/2008 and Directive 2005/29/EC. The fares indicated in airlines promotional material or on their websites often do not correspond to the ultimate true cost of buying an airline ticket. The Commission has adopted a policy of taking a stand on such practices. Nonetheless various airlines are clearly flouting the requirements on which the Commission insists. Does the Commission consider that the national supervisory authorities should monitor airlines more frequently Will the Commission adopt proactive measures to put an end to such practices,E-005477/2011,0,In European country consumer organisation joined force campaign additional charge imposed published air fare The practice making charge contrary rule consumer protection Regulation EC No Directive EC The fare indicated airline promotional material website often correspond ultimate true cost buying airline ticket The Commission adopted policy taking stand practice Nonetheless various airline clearly flouting requirement Commission insists Does Commission consider national supervisory authority monitor airline frequently Will Commission adopt proactive measure put end practice,PPE,Belgium,In some European country consumer organisation have joined force to campaign against additional charge which are imposed over and above published air fare The practice of making such charge is contrary to the rule on consumer protection Regulation EC No and Directive EC The fare indicated in airline promotional material or on their website often do not correspond to the ultimate true cost of buying an airline ticket The Commission ha adopted a policy of taking a stand on such practice Nonetheless various airline are clearly flouting the requirement on which the Commission insists Does the Commission consider that the national supervisory authority should monitor airline more frequently Will the Commission adopt proactive measure to put an end to such practice,Ivo Belet
70,Negotiations are under way for an EUIndia free trade agreement. On 26 March 2009 the European Parliament adopted a resolution which set out its wishes for the  agreement. The resolution makes express reference to a substantial development chapter in the agreement which should be subject to the standard dispute mechanism. Last year the Commission stated in its answer to questions by Caroline Lucas Verts/ALE 13.11.2009 that an ambitious chapter on sustainable development is an important objective of the EU in bilateral trade negotiations and promotion of the four core labour standards is a key objective. The EU recently concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea which contained such a chapter. It has  clear in the light of the visit to India by Parliaments India Delegation in April 2010 and through various contacts that India is not interested in a development chapter. The Indians are almost unanimous in saying that in no circumstances do they want non-trade issues to be included in the free trade agreement. In view of this dichotomy I should like to ask the following questions. 1. In the negotiations is the Commission still persevering with the request to include a substantial development chapter in the free trade agreement including mention of the four core labour standards which also should be subject to the standard dispute mechanism 2. Will the Commission break off the negotiations if this request is not met from the Indian side 3.

1606,The Irish State provides for a scheme known as the Early Child Care Education ECCE scheme which involves the payment by the State of a subsidy to support pre-school education for young children. To qualify for inclusion in the scheme a candidate child must be aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 7 months on 1 September of the year they intend  pre-school. For the year 2010 this means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 inclusive will be eligible to take part in the scheme from September 2010. For the year starting in September 2011 children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 will be eligible. Under the scheme the criteria in relation to age can be revised only in circumstances where the child in question has special needs. If it is the case that a candidates birth date falls outside the dates applied by the scheme the family is not entitled to receive support under the ECCE. This leads to families delaying a childs educational development for a year when most of their peer group members are permitted to proceed to pre-school by availing themselves of the scheme.

1501,Following the appalling tragedies in recent months in the Mediterranean in which thousands of migrants have perished the Commission published a roadmap setting out measures to tackle the catastrophic consequences of illegal immigration. More specifically the Commission announced that it would put forward a legislative proposal establishing an automatic system for the distribution of migrants among the Member States before the end of 2015. The Commission specifies that the system will take into account efforts which Member States have already made voluntarily or otherwise in other words the good pupils will be rewarded whilst the bad pupils will be punished all in the name of the principle of solidarity.

387,The past week was disastrous for the environment of the Black Sea region. A numbers of tankers sank or ran aground in the sea near the Strait of Kerch. One of them a Russian oil tanker lost at least 560 000 gallons of fuel which was spilled into the strait leading into the Black Sea. This catastrophe tells us two things. First we must establish better coordination of the shipping lanes in the Black Sea. Despite warnings about the bad weather the freighters did not change their course. Such a situation can only be prevented if cooperation among the seafaring States on the Black Sea is improved. I think this shows that institutions like the Organisation for Black Sea Economic Cooperation BSEC should be further strengthened and supported by the European Commission and the European Parliament. And second we must be prepared for this kind of disaster. The question now is how to clean up the pollution. It will be spilled into the entire Black Sea and will therefore affect all Black Sea States. It is clear to me that it is not a matter of just one or two countries but of all the States in the area. At the same time owing to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania the issue of environmental pollution of the Black Sea has  an issue on the EUs agenda. I would therefore like to ask the Commission if it will be initiating or even financing activities and measures to solve this recent ecological disaster in the Black Sea.,P-5807/07,0,The past week disastrous environment Black Sea region A number tanker sank ran aground sea near Strait Kerch One Russian oil tanker lost least gallon fuel spilled strait leading Black Sea This catastrophe tell u two thing First must establish better coordination shipping lane Black Sea Despite warning bad weather freighter change course Such situation prevented cooperation among seafaring States Black Sea improved I think show institution like Organisation Black Sea Economic Cooperation BSEC strengthened supported European Commission European Parliament And second must prepared kind disaster The question clean pollution It spilled entire Black Sea therefore affect Black Sea States It clear matter one two country States area At time owing accession Bulgaria Romania issue environmental pollution Black Sea issue EUs agenda I would therefore like ask Commission initiating even financing activity measure solve recent ecological disaster Black Sea,,Bulgaria,The past week wa disastrous for the environment of the Black Sea region A number of tanker sank or ran aground in the sea near the Strait of Kerch One of them a Russian oil tanker lost at least gallon of fuel which wa spilled into the strait leading into the Black Sea This catastrophe tell u two thing First we must establish better coordination of the shipping lane in the Black Sea Despite warning about the bad weather the freighter did not change their course Such a situation can only be prevented if cooperation among the seafaring States on the Black Sea is improved I think this show that institution like the Organisation for Black Sea Economic Cooperation BSEC should be further strengthened and supported by the European Commission and the European Parliament And second we must be prepared for this kind of disaster The question now is how to clean up the pollution It will be spilled into the entire Black Sea and will therefore affect all Black Sea States It is clear to me that it is not a matter of just one or two country but of all the States in the area At the same time owing to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania the issue of environmental pollution of the Black Sea ha an issue on the EUs agenda I would therefore like to ask the Commission if it will be initiating or even financing activity and measure to solve this recent ecological disaster in the Black Sea,Rumiana Jeleva

2781,In 2011 the Commission decided to impose anti-dumping duties  of between 48.3 and 71.9 depending on the producers concerned  on exports of stainless steel tubes and seamless pipes originating in the Peoples Republic of China investigation AD565. Despite these arrangements it seems that many Chinese manufacturers have succeeded in circumventing the anti-dumping measures in order to reach the European market via Indian exporters which has involved altering the customs codes used. Statistics show that since the duties were imposed on Chinese exports of certain pipes and tubes to the European Union the rise in exports from India has been proportional to the fall in exports from China.

2880,One of the announcements made by the Greek Government as part of its drive to stamp out tax evasion is the implementation of an electronic register of assets in 2013 for all tax residents of Greece which will record their movable and immovable property in Greece and abroad including deposits. Anyone who fails  and to declare their assets will face strict punishment apart from fines since this is being made a criminal offence.

463,In August 2017 Coldiretti and Unaapi Unione Nazionale Associazione Apicoltori Italiani  National Union of Associations of Italian Beekeepers raised the alarm regarding the extremely serious situation for Italian beekeeping. Poor weather conditions and the prolonged drought have hit Made in Italy yields very hard with losses of up to 80. Compared to the average annual 23 000 tonnes in 2016 Italian production halved to 16 000 tonnes and estimates for 2017 indicate that the yield will be approximately 9 000 to 10 000 tonnes i.e. a third of the average. In Italy there are 45 000 beekeepers producing over 50 varieties of high-quality honey translating into revenue of EUR 150 million. Bees are important not only for honey production but also for the cultivation of all agricultural products that require pollination such as fruit and vegetables and wine. The net fall in Italian production has triggered an increase in imports of low-cost honey particularly from China where the use of GMO pollen is permitted. This constitutes a potential health risk for European consumers. In view of the above will the Commission  Act to provide special funding and specific aid measures to protect Italian beekeeping in view of the difficulties being experienced by producers  Guarantee the survival of the Italian beekeeping sector which is important for the European economy by restricting imports from Asia of doubtful quality that are released onto the European market at lower prices than Made in Italy products,E-005727-17,0,In August Coldiretti Unaapi Unione Nazionale Associazione Apicoltori Italiani National Union Associations Italian Beekeepers raised alarm regarding extremely serious situation Italian beekeeping Poor weather condition prolonged drought hit Made Italy yield hard loss Compared average annual tonne Italian production halved tonne estimate indicate yield approximately tonne ie third average In Italy beekeeper producing variety highquality honey translating revenue EUR million Bees important honey production also cultivation agricultural product require pollination fruit vegetable wine The net fall Italian production triggered increase import lowcost honey particularly China use GMO pollen permitted This constitutes potential health risk European consumer In view Commission Act provide special funding specific aid measure protect Italian beekeeping view difficulty experienced producer Guarantee survival Italian beekeeping sector important European economy restricting import Asia doubtful quality released onto European market lower price Made Italy product,ENF,Italy,In August Coldiretti and Unaapi Unione Nazionale Associazione Apicoltori Italiani National Union of Associations of Italian Beekeepers raised the alarm regarding the extremely serious situation for Italian beekeeping Poor weather condition and the prolonged drought have hit Made in Italy yield very hard with loss of up to Compared to the average annual tonne in Italian production halved to tonne and estimate for indicate that the yield will be approximately to tonne ie a third of the average In Italy there are beekeeper producing over variety of highquality honey translating into revenue of EUR million Bees are important not only for honey production but also for the cultivation of all agricultural product that require pollination such a fruit and vegetable and wine The net fall in Italian production ha triggered an increase in import of lowcost honey particularly from China where the use of GMO pollen is permitted This constitutes a potential health risk for European consumer In view of the above will the Commission Act to provide special funding and specific aid measure to protect Italian beekeeping in view of the difficulty being experienced by producer Guarantee the survival of the Italian beekeeping sector which is important for the European economy by restricting import from Asia of doubtful quality that are released onto the European market at lower price than Made in Italy product,Mara Bizzotto
1336,On 13 March 2017 the Commission sent a report to Parliament and the Council on the mandatory labelling of alcoholic beverages with ingredients and nutritional information. Producers of alcoholic beverages including wine have one year to set up a system of self-regulation the Commission will impose mandatory regulation if adequate self-regulation measures have not been taken by the end of this period. The agricultural sector is bombarded by European regulations which do more harm than good. Furthermore the need for consumers to monitor the nutritional information of alcoholic drinks lies solely within the European realm of abstract ideas. In the aforementioned report the Commission refers to the industry of the sector forgetting that such regulation would increase costs for small and medium  and that wine itself is affected by natural rather than industrial changes which alter nutritional variables from one year to the next. In light of the above would the Commission not say that the proposal should be reassessed to prevent the destruction of this agricultural sector,E-002641-17,0,On March Commission sent report Parliament Council mandatory labelling alcoholic beverage ingredient nutritional information Producers alcoholic beverage including wine one year set system selfregulation Commission impose mandatory regulation adequate selfregulation measure taken end period The agricultural sector bombarded European regulation harm good Furthermore need consumer monitor nutritional information alcoholic drink lie solely within European realm abstract idea In aforementioned report Commission refers industry sector forgetting regulation would increase cost small medium wine affected natural rather industrial change alter nutritional variable one year next In light would Commission say proposal reassessed prevent destruction agricultural sector,ENF,Italy,On March the Commission sent a report to Parliament and the Council on the mandatory labelling of alcoholic beverage with ingredient and nutritional information Producers of alcoholic beverage including wine have one year to set up a system of selfregulation the Commission will impose mandatory regulation if adequate selfregulation measure have not been taken by the end of this period The agricultural sector is bombarded by European regulation which do more harm than good Furthermore the need for consumer to monitor the nutritional information of alcoholic drink lie solely within the European realm of abstract idea In the aforementioned report the Commission refers to the industry of the sector forgetting that such regulation would increase cost for small and medium and that wine itself is affected by natural rather than industrial change which alter nutritional variable from one year to the next In light of the above would the Commission not say that the proposal should be reassessed to prevent the destruction of this agricultural sector,Angelo Ciocca
1655,Recent analyses carried out by Greenpeace in the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki have given readings for TBT a toxic substance contained in antifouling paints in excess of the limits proposed by international conventions. In view of the high toxicity of this particular substance the German Government had asked the Commission to draw up a uniform European policy to restrict the use of TBT. Since that was not  within the time limits set by Germany however the German Government decided in January 2001 to ban the use of TBT through national legislation. From 1 January 2003 therefore TBT-based paints will no longer be available in Germany. As the use of TBT in Greece and the other Member States is prohibited only on vessels shorter than 25 m and on installations or equipment which  or partly below water will the Commission issue a general ban on that substance in view of the fact that less toxic substitutes are also available,P-1834/01,0,Recent analysis carried Greenpeace port Piraeus Thessaloniki given reading TBT toxic substance contained antifouling paint excess limit proposed international convention In view high toxicity particular substance German Government asked Commission draw uniform European policy restrict use TBT Since within time limit set Germany however German Government decided January ban use TBT national legislation From January therefore TBTbased paint longer available Germany As use TBT Greece Member States prohibited vessel shorter installation equipment partly water Commission issue general ban substance view fact le toxic substitute also available,GUE/NGL,Greece,Recent analysis carried out by Greenpeace in the port of Piraeus and Thessaloniki have given reading for TBT a toxic substance contained in antifouling paint in excess of the limit proposed by international convention In view of the high toxicity of this particular substance the German Government had asked the Commission to draw up a uniform European policy to restrict the use of TBT Since that wa not within the time limit set by Germany however the German Government decided in January to ban the use of TBT through national legislation From January therefore TBTbased paint will no longer be available in Germany As the use of TBT in Greece and the other Member States is prohibited only on vessel shorter than m and on installation or equipment which or partly below water will the Commission issue a general ban on that substance in view of the fact that le toxic substitute are also available,Mihail Papayannakis

One of__ of this proposal is the European Endowment for Democracy which is to be somewhat analogous to the National Endowment for Democracy currently operating in the United States. The Commission is planning to allocate a further EUR 1.24 billion to this activity. Although the EU neighbourhood policy is undoubtedly important especially for the promotion of human rights and basic freedoms and as an incentive for enhancing protection against the abuse of state power how does the Commission intend to deal with the potential wave of resistance to which this may give rise on the part of the governments of certain eastern European countries such as Ukraine where some members of the ruling Party of Regions have asserted that this type of intervention by the EU is causing unrest and weakening the country,E-009404/2011,0,The European Commission submitted proposal improving neighbourly relation country southern eastern Europe One proposal European Endowment Democracy somewhat analogous National Endowment Democracy currently operating United States The Commission planning allocate EUR billion activity Although EU neighbourhood policy undoubtedly important especially promotion human right basic freedom incentive enhancing protection abuse state power Commission intend deal potential wave resistance may give rise part government certain eastern European country Ukraine member ruling Party Regions asserted type intervention EU causing unrest weakening country,S&D,Slovakia,The European Commission ha submitted a proposal for improving neighbourly relation with the country of southern and eastern Europe One of of this proposal is the European Endowment for Democracy which is to be somewhat analogous to the National Endowment for Democracy currently operating in the United States The Commission is planning to allocate a further EUR billion to this activity Although the EU neighbourhood policy is undoubtedly important especially for the promotion of human right and basic freedom and a an incentive for enhancing protection against the abuse of state power how doe the Commission intend to deal with the potential wave of resistance to which this may give rise on the part of the government of certain eastern European country such a Ukraine where some member of the ruling Party of Regions have asserted that this type of intervention by the EU is causing unrest and weakening the country,Monika Flašíková Beňová
794,The illegal occupation by Turkish troops of the city of Famagusta in eastern Cyprus has been and is a flagrant violation of international law and of the human rights of its legitimate inhabitants. 36 years on from the Turkish invasion the occupation persists and the city remains under siege and deserted with its rightful inhabitants still unable to return legally to their city and their homes. This continued state of affairs is contrary to UN Resolutions 550 1984 and 789 1992 the UN Secretary-General has reaffirmed in a report of November 2009 that the Turkish government is responsible for the impasse. Given that this is a humanitarian issue its solution has been considered a priority in the current negotiations for an overall settlement in Cyprus. In view of Turkeys responsibility in the matter can the Commission state what forms of pressure the EU has been putting on Turkey in the context of the existing bilateral relations with a view to the return of Famagusta to its rightful inhabitants and to ensuring that Turkey fulfils its obligations What efforts has the EU made to resolve this problem,E-010189/2011,0,The illegal occupation Turkish troop city Famagusta eastern Cyprus flagrant violation international law human right legitimate inhabitant year Turkish invasion occupation persists city remains siege deserted rightful inhabitant still unable return legally city home This continued state affair contrary UN Resolutions UN SecretaryGeneral reaffirmed report November Turkish government responsible impasse Given humanitarian issue solution considered priority current negotiation overall settlement Cyprus In view Turkeys responsibility matter Commission state form pressure EU putting Turkey context existing bilateral relation view return Famagusta rightful inhabitant ensuring Turkey fulfils obligation What effort EU made resolve problem,GUE/NGL,Portugal,The illegal occupation by Turkish troop of the city of Famagusta in eastern Cyprus ha been and is a flagrant violation of international law and of the human right of it legitimate inhabitant year on from the Turkish invasion the occupation persists and the city remains under siege and deserted with it rightful inhabitant still unable to return legally to their city and their home This continued state of affair is contrary to UN Resolutions and the UN SecretaryGeneral ha reaffirmed in a report of November that the Turkish government is responsible for the impasse Given that this is a humanitarian issue it solution ha been considered a priority in the current negotiation for an overall settlement in Cyprus In view of Turkeys responsibility in the matter can the Commission state what form of pressure the EU ha been putting on Turkey in the context of the existing bilateral relation with a view to the return of Famagusta to it rightful inhabitant and to ensuring that Turkey fulfils it obligation What effort ha the EU made to resolve this problem,João Ferreira

1877,As the Council is aware there have been outbreaks of the infectious plant diseases brown rot and Thrips palmi in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. The necessary measures have been or are being taken by both the Netherlands Government and the Commission to prevent the further spread of these diseases in the Community. The farms and horticultural establishments affected will suffer considerable damage particularly if there is not an  scheme. At European level there is a financial contribution scheme for outbreaks of infectious animal diseases. However there is still no European scheme for outbreaks of infectious plant diseases. I should therefore like the answers to the following questions not least in order to remove the widespread uncertainty within the sector  for damage. 1. Is the Council prepared to establish within the foreseeable future a  scheme for outbreaks of infectious plant diseases by analogy with the existing scheme in respect of infectious animal diseases I would particularly refer to the proposal submitted by the Commission to the Council in 1989 for a Council Directive to amend Directive 77/93/EEC1 which proposes  scheme for outbreaks of infectious plant diseases Commission answer to Written Question E-3230/952. 2.

2792,In the M?_ller-Faur?/Van Riet judgment C-385/99 the Court of Justice drew a clear distinction between out-patient treatment and hospital treatment stipulating that requests for prior authorisation are contrary to the principle of the freedom to provide services only in the case of out-patient treatment provided in another Member State by a non-contracted provider. In its report on the future of health care December 2002  A5-0452/2002 for which I was rapporteur the European Parliament pointed out that the achievement of the objectives of sustainability accessibility and quality of health services requires inter alia the creation of an internal market in health services and products which must guarantee high quality health care accessible to and affordable for all taking into account the viability and capacity of the Member States systems and guaranteeing both free movement of citizens and access to services in all countries of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity. Why did the Courts ruling not follow these principles with regard to hospital treatment Will the Commission answer the following questions in particular  how can it reconcile this ruling with the rights of European citizens whose right to health care is now guaranteed only in the case of out-patient treatment and not hospital treatment a measure based purely on economic grounds  how can it reconcile this dual regime where there is freedom of choice for out-patient treatment but a requirement for prior authorisation for hospital treatment with the guarantee of a high level of health protection provided for in the Treaties  how can the exercise of free choice by European citizens jeopardise the financial balance of a national system when it does not pay a higher rate of reimbursement for services provided in another Member State than it does under its own system  given that under the terms of Regulation No 1408/711 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community the Member States have already introduced mechanisms for subsequent reimbursement of treatment provided in another Member State how can it justify the technical problems placed in the way of reimbursement between Member States in cases where European citizens have exercised their freedom to choose the location of hospital treatment  the requirement to request prior authorisation for hospital treatment not a means of denying freedom of choice to patients on the basis of quality and accessibility to all thereby discriminating

2851,According to the Vaxholm judgment Sweden cannot require the same terms and conditions of employment for Swedish and foreign labour performing work in Sweden. It is no longer possible for Sweden to require foreign workers to be covered by the same high level of working conditions as those applying on the Swedish labour market. According to the judgment the minimum standards laid down in the directive on the posting of workers set a ceiling on the requirements Member States may lay down. The judgment also maintains that it would be less attractive for foreign workers  and work temporarily in Sweden. It is claimed that worse pay and conditions will give foreign workers  edge on the Swedish labour market. Worse conditions for foreign workers in Sweden however exert downwards pressure on pay and working conditions for all workers in the country. There is also a risk of creating a race towards the lowest minimum wage level within the EU as a whole. In other words pay and working conditions  an instrument  within the EU.

1138,The case of the Pakistanis residing in Greece who were abducted and interrogated on Greek territory has acquired a very high profile in Greece and the United Kingdom. Although the Greek Government initially denied these events it has emerged that members of the secret service of another country presumably the United Kingdom took part in these operations alongside Greek agents. These abductions and interrogations are probably linked to the major issue of the imprisonment torture and transfer of terrorist suspects covertly undertaken in EU Member States and applicant countries. There is good reason to suppose that if any evidence had emerged of a possible link between the abducted Pakistanis and terrorist circles the former would have  phantom prisoners held in secret prisons without legal rights or access to legal assistance and been subject to inhuman treatment.

It is the general view in Greece that the four aircraft were sold for scrap metal in a gruelling race against time to meet the three-month deadlines imposed under the medium-term privatisation programme from which international speculators have benefited outrageously. The whiff of scandal surrounding the sale of the aircraft at such a giveaway price undoubtedly warrants investigation. In view of this coupled with the fact that the proceeds from the first phase of privatisations have been estimated to amount to a sum of EUR 50 billion and irrespective of any views which may be held regarding the sale of public assets 1. Does the Commission consider that the sale price of the four Airbus aircraft corresponds to the range of estimates made under the Medium-Term Programme If as is generally considered in Greece this is not the case is the Commission concerned that remaining Greek public assets up for sale may go the way of these four aircraft 2. Given the anger and exasperation felt by the Greek people at not only the sale of Greek public assets but also the outrageously low prices at which they are being disposed can the Commission a itemise the assets sold for EUR 50 billion giving the estimated selling price of each b indicate which assets have been scheduled for sale in  quarter and c say whether it is admissible for Greek Government to accept without demur such a devaluation of public assets  EL C 75 E 14/03/2013,E-000446/2012,0,In bid meet gruelling schedule imposed MediumTerm Fiscal Adjustment Programme Greek Government sold four Airbus A aircraft USbased Apollo Aviation corporation total EUR million The sale price four Airbus aircraft ridiculously say scandalously low considering aircraft purchased approximately EUR million total EUR million b following valuation Finance Ministry minimum selling price set EUR million c highest bid response previous unsuccessful call tender EUR million It general view Greece four aircraft sold scrap metal gruelling race time meet threemonth deadline imposed mediumterm privatisation programme international speculator benefited outrageously The whiff scandal surrounding sale aircraft giveaway price undoubtedly warrant investigation In view coupled fact proceeds first phase privatisation estimated amount sum EUR billion irrespective view may held regarding sale public asset Does Commission consider sale price four Airbus aircraft corresponds range estimate made MediumTerm Programme If generally considered Greece case Commission concerned remaining Greek public asset sale may go way four aircraft Given anger exasperation felt Greek people sale Greek public asset also outrageously low price disposed Commission itemise asset sold EUR billion giving estimated selling price b indicate asset scheduled sale quarter c say whether admissible Greek Government accept without demur devaluation public asset EL C E,GUE/NGL,Greece,In a bid to meet the gruelling schedule imposed by the MediumTerm Fiscal Adjustment Programme the Greek Government ha sold four Airbus A aircraft to the USbased Apollo Aviation corporation for a total of EUR million The sale price for the four Airbus aircraft is ridiculously not to say scandalously low considering that a the aircraft were purchased for approximately EUR million each a total of EUR million b following valuation by the Finance Ministry in the minimum selling price wa set at EUR million and c the highest bid in response to a previous unsuccessful call for tender in wa EUR million It is the general view in Greece that the four aircraft were sold for scrap metal in a gruelling race against time to meet the threemonth deadline imposed under the mediumterm privatisation programme from which international speculator have benefited outrageously The whiff of scandal surrounding the sale of the aircraft at such a giveaway price undoubtedly warrant investigation In view of this coupled with the fact that the proceeds from the first phase of privatisation have been estimated to amount to a sum of EUR billion and irrespective of any view which may be held regarding the sale of public asset Does the Commission consider that the sale price of the four Airbus aircraft corresponds to the range of estimate made under the MediumTerm Programme If a is generally considered in Greece this is not the case is the Commission concerned that remaining Greek public asset up for sale may go the way of these four aircraft Given the anger and exasperation felt by the Greek people at not only the sale of Greek public asset but also the outrageously low price at which they are being disposed can the Commission a itemise the asset sold for EUR billion giving the estimated selling price of each b indicate which asset have been scheduled for sale in quarter and c say whether it is admissible for Greek Government to accept without demur such a devaluation of public asset EL C E,Nikolaos Chountis
279,According to an investigation by the Investigate Europe1 network published in 12 media outlets in 10 European countries the proposal to create a Pan-European Pension Product PEPP currently being discussed in the  of the European Parliament is inspired by BlackRock  managing USD US 6 trillion 80 of  from pensions as its executives claim.

184,The European Space Agency is considering cooperating with Russia to build a permanent base on the moon as a replacement for the International Space Station. There are also plans to embark upon a joint European and Russian mission to Mars. I am astonished by this not just at the choice of Russia as a partner in strategic space projects but also at the timing of these decisions. Following its annexation of Crimea and its aggression in eastern Ukraine both of which are illegal under international law the Russian Federation is an aggressor country and this is reflected in the sanctions that still apply against the country. The aims behind Russias space policy are best demonstrated by the man responsible for the space industry. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin has in a way  an icon of the new Russian imperialism. The Russians have been unsuccessfully sending probes to planets all over the solar system since 1985. Cooperation on the Galileo programme also left much to be desired. In my view planning strategic projects with an unreliable and politically unpredictable country is a major mistake and events will take a similar turn to the situation as regards the building of Russias Vostochny Cosmodrome which is a venture that is largely being indirectly funded by the West  contracts for the use of Soyuz-2 rockets.

969,I recently met representatives from tomato and prune producer organisations who are concerned about the imminent disappearance of part of the support for their sector. The 2007 reform of this sector extended the principle of decoupling to cover fruit and vegetables gradually including tomato and prune production in the single payment scheme. Total decoupling is expected at the end of 2011 in the case of tomatoes and at the end of 2012 in the case of prunes. This means that on those dates areas which were already under production during the historical reference period chosen between 2001 and 2006 for tomatoes and up to 2007 for prunes will benefit from a payment based on historical references. In practice the end of partial decoupling involves two types of very unequal scenarios producers with historical references will continue to receive payments which will however  decoupled more recent producers who planted crops after 2006 without historical references and until then benefited from coupled aid are no longer receiving such aid as of 1 January 2012 in the case of tomatoes and will cease to receive it on 1 January 2013 in the case of prunes. As far as tomatoes are concerned this is equivalent to more than half the tomatoes processed in France. Total decoupling  deprives certain producers of support while  as well as threatening the future of industries and employment in a context of high production costs and  In its proposals for the reform of the PAC after 2013 the Commission mentions the possibility for Member States to grant coupled aid from 2014 for certain products including fruit and vegetables. In the second scenario described above no aid is planned from 1 January 2011 to 1 January 2014. To deal with this unfairness which is surely not confined to France with its damaging economic and social consequences will the Commission consider keeping the current provisions of the CAP on recoupled aid for the industries concerned without prejudice of course to what will happen in the next CAP reform  FR C 86 E 25/03/2014,E-001267-12,0,I recently met representative tomato prune producer organisation concerned imminent disappearance part support sector The reform sector extended principle decoupling cover fruit vegetable gradually including tomato prune production single payment scheme Total decoupling expected end case tomato end case prune This mean date area already production historical reference period chosen tomato prune benefit payment based historical reference In practice end partial decoupling involves two type unequal scenario producer historical reference continue receive payment however decoupled recent producer planted crop without historical reference benefited coupled aid longer receiving aid January case tomato cease receive January case prune As far tomato concerned equivalent half tomato processed France Total decoupling deprives certain producer support well threatening future industry employment context high production cost In proposal reform PAC Commission mention possibility Member States grant coupled aid certain product including fruit vegetable In second scenario described aid planned January January To deal unfairness surely confined France damaging economic social consequence Commission consider keeping current provision CAP recoupled aid industry concerned without prejudice course happen next CAP reform FR C E,S&D,France,I recently met representative from tomato and prune producer organisation who are concerned about the imminent disappearance of part of the support for their sector The reform of this sector extended the principle of decoupling to cover fruit and vegetable gradually including tomato and prune production in the single payment scheme Total decoupling is expected at the end of in the case of tomato and at the end of in the case of prune This mean that on those date area which were already under production during the historical reference period chosen between and for tomato and up to for prune will benefit from a payment based on historical reference In practice the end of partial decoupling involves two type of very unequal scenario producer with historical reference will continue to receive payment which will however decoupled more recent producer who planted crop after without historical reference and until then benefited from coupled aid are no longer receiving such aid a of January in the case of tomato and will cease to receive it on January in the case of prune As far a tomato are concerned this is equivalent to more than half the tomato processed in France Total decoupling deprives certain producer of support while a well a threatening the future of industry and employment in a context of high production cost and In it proposal for the reform of the PAC after the Commission mention the possibility for Member States to grant coupled aid from for certain product including fruit and vegetable In the second scenario described above no aid is planned from January to January To deal with this unfairness which is surely not confined to France with it damaging economic and social consequence will the Commission consider keeping the current provision of the CAP on recoupled aid for the industry concerned without prejudice of course to what will happen in the next CAP reform FR C E,Stéphane Le Foll
2025,1. The Netherlands Ministry of Finance has recently published figures eighth progress report on the euro and public authorities on the lack of progress in introducing the euro by public authorities. For example it appears that 64  of Dutch local authorities have not yet started implementation of the euro process. Some local authorities 4  in fact have not even started with their preparations. Local authorities are lagging well behind in the fields  and information in particular. Only 16  have drawn up an  plan and only 31  have an  plan. Only 45  have a management plan for adjusting their administrative systems. The preparations made by 60  of social services and about 70  of the implementing bodies are a cause for concern with many still in the initial stock-taking phase.

2867,According to an article in Turkish newspaper Zaman 20/12 Turkeys school textbooks for school years 2011-2012 make use of expressions undermining the spirit of good neighbourliness. The errors inconsistencies and exaggerated national bombast are based on historic falsehoods. The quoted excerpts are from a tenth-grade middle school textbook Ortao__retim Tarih 10. S_±n_±f. Children read that the Ottomans and the Turks always showed clemency to the Assyrians the Romious/Greeks and the Armenians of Turkey and abroad but were repaid with ingratitude and malice. The books systematically emphasise the forbearance of the Turks. It is not difficult to predict the future feelings of the new generation after receiving such an education. According to these books the others were foreigners who played into the hands of Turkeys enemies in order to wreak evil in the land. Even today Greece is depicted as having designs on Turkish territories p. 158. I also believe that  on pages 156-161 178-180 198 199 and 203 will be of great interest to the Commission. Greece has made some obvious cuts to history taught at schools for the sake of peaceful neighbourliness the history book  for use by sixth-year primary school pupils being a case in point.

1159,On 19 December 2011 a Congolese citizen Samba Martine died at the Aluche immigrant detention centre in Madrid. According to the Spanish Ombudsmans 2012 annual report her death was due to a lack  between institutions which meant that she was not given the right treatment as someone with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. The immigrant held at Aluche had been diagnosed as HIV-positive at the Melilla temporary detention centre for immigrants but was transferred to the Aluche immigrant detention centre in Madrid without the latter centre being given any information whatsoever about her health status. This meant that at Aluche she was diagnosed with different illnesses and the centres doctors treated her on the basis of the different diagnoses without realising that she was HIV-positive which consequently led to her death. Immigrant detention centres in Spain must treat those in the process of being deported in a way that respects their human rights and international humanitarian law. Under Directive 2008/115/EC they must provide emergency healthcare and essential treatment of illness. The case of Samba Martine shows that the lack of coordination between the Aluche immigrant detention centre and the Melilla temporary detention centre for immigrants led to a diagnostic error which meant that she was not given the essential treatment for her illness which indirectly caused her death. In addition to this case there is the case of Idrissa Diallo and many other immigrants who have lost their lives in immigrant detention centres in Spain suggesting that human rights and the aforementioned directive are being systematically violated.

410,The prefecture of Zakynthos is facing acute problems arising from salination of ground water and water shortages particularly during the summer months as a result of increased tourist demand. Under the National Water Resource Management and Conservation Programme drawn up by the National Technical University of Athens in 2008 the region administered by the Northern Peloponnese Water Authority to which Zakynthos belongs has the necessary water resources. However the geographical and chronological balance between supply and demand is  extremely delicate. For this reason water storage transport and management projects are necessary. In response to the problem eight new drilling projects carried out in the Kerio area of Zakynthos were included in the third CSF. Since the water obtained from these wells was found to be brackish and unsuitable for domestic use without further special treatment the Ionian Island Regional Authority accordingly adopted a decision imposing environmental conditions making use of the wells subject to the provision of a desalination plant. However this is meeting with opposition on the part of residents and local authorities concerned that the desalination plant will have a disastrous impact on ground water as well as being extremely expensive to operate. Instead they call for the channelling and storage of water from the heavy rainfalls in Zakynthos rather than the massive overexploitation of increasingly substandard groundwater resources. The National Water Resource Management and Conservation Programme is also in favour of water storage initiatives in this area. In view of this can the Commission provide the following information 1. Is it aware of this situation 2. Has it been informed about the National Water Resource Management and Conservation Programme 3. What view does it take of the projected eight new wells and desalination plant in the light of the  contained in the national programme guidelines 4.

3416,I am deeply concerned about the mussel fishing industry and cockle fishermen in Ireland. In Castlemaine Co. Kerry the statutory management plans and environmental assessment of the area will not be able to be finalised for some time. However an interim management plan and the interim environmental assessment for Castlemaine Harbour will be sent to the Department of Environment.

Can the Commission confirm if it has received these interim documents Will the Commission do everything in its power to protect the Irish mussel fishery The mussel fishermen in Castlemaine have little time left. If work is not started on this document immediately they will lose this season and the loss will be felt for the next three years. The Irish Governments failure to act in the past if continued puts 80 jobs at stake for the next three years in the mussel industry in Castlemaine Co. Kerry.

3391,Each Member State has its own national laws relating to religion and these are increasingly the subject of political debate. In 2015 both Iceland and Norway abolished the blasphemy laws included in their criminal codes following the example of the Netherlands which did so in 2012. However many European countries still have legislation providing for the punishment of blasphemy or similar laws. In Spain for example Article 525 of the Penal Code punishes the vilification of religious feelings dogmas beliefs or rituals as a crime in practice this is very close to a blasphemy law depending on the interpretation of the judge. Even if rarely enforced religious insult laws in Europe are extremely dangerous since they can lend legitimacy to more severe blasphemy laws in other countries when countries lacking democracy and freedom of expression are criticised for punishing people for blasphemy including with death sentences their politicians correctly point out that similar laws are in force in Western democracies. Taking into account the potential repercussions of laws of this kind for the EUs external actions and policies concerning human rights does the Commission think that on the basis of Article 83 TFEU it would be useful to abolish the offence of blasphemy or similar offences in Europe In positive terms what actions is the Commission taking in order to avoid the criminalisation of blasphemy and thus preserve freedom of expression in Member StatesLegal notice,E-000485-16,0,Each Member State national law relating religion increasingly subject political debate In Iceland Norway abolished blasphemy law included criminal code following example Netherlands However many European country still legislation providing punishment blasphemy similar law In Spain example Article Penal Code punishes vilification religious feeling dogma belief ritual crime practice close blasphemy law depending interpretation judge Even rarely enforced religious insult law Europe extremely dangerous since lend legitimacy severe blasphemy law country country lacking democracy freedom expression criticised punishing people blasphemy including death sentence politician correctly point similar law force Western democracy Taking account potential repercussion law kind EUs external action policy concerning human right Commission think basis Article TFEU would useful abolish offence blasphemy similar offence Europe In positive term action Commission taking order avoid criminalisation blasphemy thus preserve freedom expression Member StatesLegal notice,ALDE,Spain,Each Member State ha it own national law relating to religion and these are increasingly the subject of political debate In both Iceland and Norway abolished the blasphemy law included in their criminal code following the example of the Netherlands which did so in However many European country still have legislation providing for the punishment of blasphemy or similar law In Spain for example Article of the Penal Code punishes the vilification of religious feeling dogma belief or ritual a a crime in practice this is very close to a blasphemy law depending on the interpretation of the judge Even if rarely enforced religious insult law in Europe are extremely dangerous since they can lend legitimacy to more severe blasphemy law in other country when country lacking democracy and freedom of expression are criticised for punishing people for blasphemy including with death sentence their politician correctly point out that similar law are in force in Western democracy Taking into account the potential repercussion of law of this kind for the EUs external action and policy concerning human right doe the Commission think that on the basis of Article TFEU it would be useful to abolish the offence of blasphemy or similar offence in Europe In positive term what action is the Commission taking in order to avoid the criminalisation of blasphemy and thus preserve freedom of expression in Member StatesLegal notice,María Teresa Giménez Barbat

1748,Article 1 of Regulation EEC No 1576/89 of 29 May 19891 laying down general rules on the definition description and presentation of spirit drinks states The name grape marc or grape marc spirit may be replaced by the designation grappa solely for the spirit drink produced in Italy. Grappa is a product behind which there lies a centuries-old tradition dating back to 1601 and the foundation in Venice of the Accademia degli Acquavitai distillers academy a school which contributed over two centuries to the training of the best master-distillers and to the perfecting of a difficult and fascinating art. It is thanks to this historical legacy that grappa has  known worldwide as a highly-regarded designation. The reputation and quality of this spirit drink hitherto characterised by a traditional and geographical designation must therefore be protected. The risk now exists of this major Italian tradition being questioned thanks to the legislative revision which could lead to the removal of the existing definition of grappa from the regulation concerned. Any such amendment of the regulation would call in question the specificity of a traditional product which is now considered to symbolise what is made in Italy. Such a move would sow confusion among consumers and would be economically damaging for the entire industry. Can the Commission state 1. whether it does not believe that this typical Italian product should be protected in a Europe of 25 whose unity can only be enhanced by the preservation and protection of the history and traditions of all  forming it 2. what measures it intends to adopt for the protection of this traditional product,E-0813/05,0,Article Regulation EEC No May laying general rule definition description presentation spirit drink state The name grape marc grape marc spirit may replaced designation grappa solely spirit drink produced Italy Grappa product behind lie centuriesold tradition dating back foundation Venice Accademia degli Acquavitai distiller academy school contributed two century training best masterdistillers perfecting difficult fascinating art It thanks historical legacy grappa known worldwide highlyregarded designation The reputation quality spirit drink hitherto characterised traditional geographical designation must therefore protected The risk exists major Italian tradition questioned thanks legislative revision could lead removal existing definition grappa regulation concerned Any amendment regulation would call question specificity traditional product considered symbolise made Italy Such move would sow confusion among consumer would economically damaging entire industry Can Commission state whether believe typical Italian product protected Europe whose unity enhanced preservation protection history tradition forming measure intends adopt protection traditional product,PPE-DE,Italy,Article of Regulation EEC No of May laying down general rule on the definition description and presentation of spirit drink state The name grape marc or grape marc spirit may be replaced by the designation grappa solely for the spirit drink produced in Italy Grappa is a product behind which there lie a centuriesold tradition dating back to and the foundation in Venice of the Accademia degli Acquavitai distiller academy a school which contributed over two century to the training of the best masterdistillers and to the perfecting of a difficult and fascinating art It is thanks to this historical legacy that grappa ha known worldwide a a highlyregarded designation The reputation and quality of this spirit drink hitherto characterised by a traditional and geographical designation must therefore be protected The risk now exists of this major Italian tradition being questioned thanks to the legislative revision which could lead to the removal of the existing definition of grappa from the regulation concerned Any such amendment of the regulation would call in question the specificity of a traditional product which is now considered to symbolise what is made in Italy Such a move would sow confusion among consumer and would be economically damaging for the entire industry Can the Commission state whether it doe not believe that this typical Italian product should be protected in a Europe of whose unity can only be enhanced by the preservation and protection of the history and tradition of all forming it what measure it intends to adopt for the protection of this traditional product,Amalia Sartori
3441,Since April 2007 in Germany discount contracts pursuant to Article 130a8 of Volume V of the Social Security Code have increasingly been concluded by statutory health insurance funds. By means of these contracts statutory health insurance funds select  through which they will procure medicines for their policy-holders. In so doing health insurance funds act as awarders of public contracts to select among the medicines available at pharmacies as pharmacists are now only permitted to sell medicines covered by discount contracts.  which are not among the health insurance funds discount contract partners lose all their market shares with the insurance funds concerned. Discount contracts account for a substantial proportion of procurement in some cases amounting to more than EUR 2 billion and have so far mostly been concluded without regard to the requirements of Directive 2004/18/EC1 concerning the award of public contracts. The Commission considers that public procurement law must  with and in October 2007 brought an action against the Federal Republic of Germany for infringement of the Treaty. Yet to this day 60  of procurement by statutory health insurance funds takes place under the cover of discount contracts which violate public procurement law and relate to the whole range of a  products. The volume of  untransparent discount contracts which are concluded by private treaty is thought to far exceed EUR 2 billion. The Federal Republic of Germany has now declared public procurement law also to be applicable to statutory health insurance. Nonetheless portfolio contracts concluded by private treaty continue to be performed. The Federal Government and supervisory authorities have not yet taken any action. Yet the revision of the Remedies Directive is intended precisely to halt the conclusion of public contracts by private treaty. 1. What measures will the Commission take in view of the substantial volume of the market in order to induce the Federal Republic of Germany to actually enforce public procurement law with regard to portfolio contracts 2.

857,We hear with growing concern of the worsening persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo due to the Serbian policy of Ethnic Cleansing. This question highlights the repression in the educational sphere. A Serb police occupation of the University of Prishtina which has now continued for 7 years has forced the ethnic Albanians out of the university buildings. Albanians attempt to continue with clandestine teaching yet teachers are beaten when discovered holding classes in their mother tongue. Peaceful protests are violently quashed by the Serb police and 80 of University buildings stand empty. Could the Council specify 1. How it intends to apply diplomatic pressure in reaction to Serbian policy which contravenes international law guaranteeing the fundamental human right to education in mother tongues 2. Why the decision to set up a European representative in Kosovo agreed several months ago has still not been implemented 3. Any further measures it may intend to put in motion to restore democratic and civil freedoms or pressure it may bring to bear upon Milosevic in particular concerning the Serbian failure to implement the Educational Agreement of 1996 signed between Presiding Rugova and Milosevic to ease tensions as a previous response to international pressure regarding economic sanctions.,E-0535/98,0,We hear growing concern worsening persecution ethnic Albanians Kosovo due Serbian policy Ethnic Cleansing This question highlight repression educational sphere A Serb police occupation University Prishtina continued year forced ethnic Albanians university building Albanians attempt continue clandestine teaching yet teacher beaten discovered holding class mother tongue Peaceful protest violently quashed Serb police University building stand empty Could Council specify How intends apply diplomatic pressure reaction Serbian policy contravenes international law guaranteeing fundamental human right education mother tongue Why decision set European representative Kosovo agreed several month ago still implemented Any measure may intend put motion restore democratic civil freedom pressure may bring bear upon Milosevic particular concerning Serbian failure implement Educational Agreement signed Presiding Rugova Milosevic ease tension previous response international pressure regarding economic sanction,PSE,Belgium,We hear with growing concern of the worsening persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo due to the Serbian policy of Ethnic Cleansing This question highlight the repression in the educational sphere A Serb police occupation of the University of Prishtina which ha now continued for year ha forced the ethnic Albanians out of the university building Albanians attempt to continue with clandestine teaching yet teacher are beaten when discovered holding class in their mother tongue Peaceful protest are violently quashed by the Serb police and of University building stand empty Could the Council specify How it intends to apply diplomatic pressure in reaction to Serbian policy which contravenes international law guaranteeing the fundamental human right to education in mother tongue Why the decision to set up a European representative in Kosovo agreed several month ago ha still not been implemented Any further measure it may intend to put in motion to restore democratic and civil freedom or pressure it may bring to bear upon Milosevic in particular concerning the Serbian failure to implement the Educational Agreement of signed between Presiding Rugova and Milosevic to ease tension a a previous response to international pressure regarding economic sanction,Raymonde Dury
2108,Southern Brittany is now having to deal with the problem of pellets of fuel oil from the Prestige which sank off the Galician coast over six months ago being washed up along its shores. The hulk is still leaking oil and we now have proof that the decision to tow the Prestige away from the Spanish coast helped ensure more extensive and widespread pollution of the European coastline. The risk of pollution will remain unless and until the oil lying at the bottom of the sea in the vessel is removed. The techniques used to pump up oil from the Erika cannot be used on this occasion as the Prestige is lying at too great a depth. The attempts made by Ifremer to seal up the wreck by robot have not proved sufficiently effective and at present about a tonne of oil is leaking per day. At that rate it could take months or even years for the risk to disappear. Along the European coastline two activities have been particularly badly affected by this disaster fishing and aquaculture which are directly affected by the pollution and the tourist industry for which clean beaches are a priority. Everyone is asking the same question When will this pollution stop Does the Commission at last have any plans to issue a call for an international project to neutralise the oil pollution caused by the Prestige If so when will it do so Does the Commission have any plans to set up a Eurocorps for civil emergencies to allow the rapid deployment of qualified human resources and appropriate technical means to clean up affected areas Does the Commission have any plans to consider the construction of anti-pollution vessels designed to track down pollution at sea rather than waiting for it to wash up on our shores,E-1638/03,0,Southern Brittany deal problem pellet fuel oil Prestige sank Galician coast six month ago washed along shore The hulk still leaking oil proof decision tow Prestige away Spanish coast helped ensure extensive widespread pollution European coastline The risk pollution remain unless oil lying bottom sea vessel removed The technique used pump oil Erika cannot used occasion Prestige lying great depth The attempt made Ifremer seal wreck robot proved sufficiently effective present tonne oil leaking per day At rate could take month even year risk disappear Along European coastline two activity particularly badly affected disaster fishing aquaculture directly affected pollution tourist industry clean beach priority Everyone asking question When pollution stop Does Commission last plan issue call international project neutralise oil pollution caused Prestige If Does Commission plan set Eurocorps civil emergency allow rapid deployment qualified human resource appropriate technical mean clean affected area Does Commission plan consider construction antipollution vessel designed track pollution sea rather waiting wash shore,PSE,France,Southern Brittany is now having to deal with the problem of pellet of fuel oil from the Prestige which sank off the Galician coast over six month ago being washed up along it shore The hulk is still leaking oil and we now have proof that the decision to tow the Prestige away from the Spanish coast helped ensure more extensive and widespread pollution of the European coastline The risk of pollution will remain unless and until the oil lying at the bottom of the sea in the vessel is removed The technique used to pump up oil from the Erika cannot be used on this occasion a the Prestige is lying at too great a depth The attempt made by Ifremer to seal up the wreck by robot have not proved sufficiently effective and at present about a tonne of oil is leaking per day At that rate it could take month or even year for the risk to disappear Along the European coastline two activity have been particularly badly affected by this disaster fishing and aquaculture which are directly affected by the pollution and the tourist industry for which clean beach are a priority Everyone is asking the same question When will this pollution stop Does the Commission at last have any plan to issue a call for an international project to neutralise the oil pollution caused by the Prestige If so when will it do so Does the Commission have any plan to set up a Eurocorps for civil emergency to allow the rapid deployment of qualified human resource and appropriate technical mean to clean up affected area Does the Commission have any plan to consider the construction of antipollution vessel designed to track down pollution at sea rather than waiting for it to wash up on our shore,Bernard Poignant
867,Urban transport is responsible for 40 of all CO2 generated by road transport and for up to 70 of all transport pollution. The EU is already a world leader in reducing CO2 emissions and in terms of the long-term objectives in this area. In view of the importance of reducing CO2 emissions I would like to ask what programmes and amounts have been devoted at European level to replacing current public transport vehicles with less polluting vehicles. As things stand insufficient information is available in respect of evaluating the impact of the directive on Non-polluting Vehicles Directive 2009/33/EC owing to the lack of any Member State reporting requirements and late transposal of the directive by the majority of Member States.,E-007500-16,0,Urban transport responsible CO generated road transport transport pollution The EU already world leader reducing CO emission term longterm objective area In view importance reducing CO emission I would like ask programme amount devoted European level replacing current public transport vehicle le polluting vehicle As thing stand insufficient information available respect evaluating impact directive Nonpolluting Vehicles Directive EC owing lack Member State reporting requirement late transposal directive majority Member States,S&D,Romania,Urban transport is responsible for of all CO generated by road transport and for up to of all transport pollution The EU is already a world leader in reducing CO emission and in term of the longterm objective in this area In view of the importance of reducing CO emission I would like to ask what programme and amount have been devoted at European level to replacing current public transport vehicle with le polluting vehicle As thing stand insufficient information is available in respect of evaluating the impact of the directive on Nonpolluting Vehicles Directive EC owing to the lack of any Member State reporting requirement and late transposal of the directive by the majority of Member States,Dan Nica
139,The powers and initiatives for the planning of land and environmental policies in Greece are concentrated at central level while the implementation and management of those policies is in the hands of local government bodies. Frequently the views of local organisations are ignored during the planning stage and even worse those organisations are required to implement government decisions without the necessary resources and funding being made available. The lack of continuity between central and local public administration constitutes a potential threat to economic growth which has a direct impact on land policy. In view of the intense interest of late in investment plans for tourist development and the government intentions to back those up the Commissions initiatives and measures to extend broadband networks and services and the rapid development of geographic information system technology will the Commission answer the following questions 1. What measures and policies are in place to assist coastal municipalities to resist the pressure to make changes in the use of their coastal areas and to tackle the effects of climate change such as the rise in sea level 2. Does the Commission intend to support measures to promote the use of innovative surveillance and early-warning systems in response for example to the pollution of coasts streams and springs the rise in sea level etc. at local level 3. Does it intend to encourage measures by large municipalities or networks of smaller ones to use modern GIS for the monitoring and management of land use 4.

Under the legislation in force the Commission has taken decisions authorising GMOs without seeking the opinions of the Member States in support of the Commission.

501,The Egyptian researcher Ali Abd al-Aal interviewed by a Lebanese TV station said that at least 80 of the 50 million Muslims in Europe are living on social welfare benefits granted by their host countries. The social welfare systems of some EU countries are therefore acting like a magnet encouraging what  known as welfare tourism whereby individuals who have never contributed through their work to the welfare system of a Member State are making the absolute most of its benefits while the citizens of that country are being continually penalised due to the cuts made necessary by the insufficiency of available resources.

940,According to the Commission losses to the Italian market directly resulting from the embargo imposed by Moscow will amount to EUR 163 million out of a total of EUR 705 million in agri-food exports to Russia. However Maurizio Martino the Italian Minister for Agriculture addressing the European Parliaments Committee on Agriculture maintained that Italian producers would sustain losses of around EUR 200 million. Moreover the import ban could generate a series of knock-on effects affecting not only the agri-food sector but also other sectors involved in Italian exports to Russia. In view of this 1. Can the Commission without delay indicate the possible direct and indirect impact on the entire Italian market of the Russian embargo and the losses likely to be sustained 2.

1621,On the border between Egypt and Israel an Eritrean widow and mother-of-three was killed while trying to flee from her homeland to seek international protection. The perpetrators of this murder were the Egyptian border police. They riddled the young womans body with bullets and she died in hospital in terrible agony. Before dying the widow told an activist  an observer for the EveryOne group in the northern Sinai and Chair of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights of Arish Egypt  that she had travelled to northern Sinai to reach Israel for the sole purpose of taking her children away from the humanitarian crisis in Eritrea. Unfortunately the slaughter of innocents has been going on for years without any intervention from international institutions and with the  of those countries that refuse entry to those fleeing from wars persecution and disasters. Every year dozens of Eritrean refugees are killed by Egyptian border guards on the border with Israel and those who manage to survive are arrested and imprisoned for around two years waiting to be deported to their homelands. Many of them die in prison because of a lack of medication and the harsh conditions of imprisonment. As if this appalling situation were not enough many refugees fall into the hands of traffickers and their bodies are later found in the desert without documents and without kidneys. This points to the existence of a major human organ trafficking ring in northern Sinai. Given that the EveryOne organisation has already issued numerous appeals to attract the attention of the international institutions United Nations High Commissioners and EU authorities to encourage them to persuade Egypt to stop persecuting refugees will the Vice-President/High Representative raise awareness among the institutions about this situation in which human rights are being violated and many innocent human beings killed,E-010183/2011,0,On border Egypt Israel Eritrean widow motherofthree killed trying flee homeland seek international protection The perpetrator murder Egyptian border police They riddled young woman body bullet died hospital terrible agony Before dying widow told activist observer EveryOne group northern Sinai Chair New Generation Foundation Human Rights Arish Egypt travelled northern Sinai reach Israel sole purpose taking child away humanitarian crisis Eritrea Unfortunately slaughter innocent going year without intervention international institution country refuse entry fleeing war persecution disaster Every year dozen Eritrean refugee killed Egyptian border guard border Israel manage survive arrested imprisoned around two year waiting deported homeland Many die prison lack medication harsh condition imprisonment As appalling situation enough many refugee fall hand trafficker body later found desert without document without kidney This point existence major human organ trafficking ring northern Sinai Given EveryOne organisation already issued numerous appeal attract attention international institution United Nations High Commissioners EU authority encourage persuade Egypt stop persecuting refugee VicePresidentHigh Representative raise awareness among institution situation human right violated many innocent human being killed,EFD,Italy,On the border between Egypt and Israel an Eritrean widow and motherofthree wa killed while trying to flee from her homeland to seek international protection The perpetrator of this murder were the Egyptian border police They riddled the young woman body with bullet and she died in hospital in terrible agony Before dying the widow told an activist an observer for the EveryOne group in the northern Sinai and Chair of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights of Arish Egypt that she had travelled to northern Sinai to reach Israel for the sole purpose of taking her child away from the humanitarian crisis in Eritrea Unfortunately the slaughter of innocent ha been going on for year without any intervention from international institution and with the of those country that refuse entry to those fleeing from war persecution and disaster Every year dozen of Eritrean refugee are killed by Egyptian border guard on the border with Israel and those who manage to survive are arrested and imprisoned for around two year waiting to be deported to their homeland Many of them die in prison because of a lack of medication and the harsh condition of imprisonment As if this appalling situation were not enough many refugee fall into the hand of trafficker and their body are later found in the desert without document and without kidney This point to the existence of a major human organ trafficking ring in northern Sinai Given that the EveryOne organisation ha already issued numerous appeal to attract the attention of the international institution United Nations High Commissioners and EU authority to encourage them to persuade Egypt to stop persecuting refugee will the VicePresidentHigh Representative raise awareness among the institution about this situation in which human right are being violated and many innocent human being killed,Oreste Rossi

1832,The European Unions Member States like all developed countries have to manage the disposal and where possible the recycling of enormous quantities of household waste. Although it involves high costs it does not fully eliminate the negative impact of waste on the natural environment and thus on human health. One of the most effective measures for facilitating the disposal of waste and one which many Member States have now adopted as a result consists of organising separated collection of household waste. This leaves it up to citizens to pre-select and sort their own waste with the aim of reducing disposal costs and facilitating the recycling of materials. However although this tool has proved quite useful there are still some problems that make it less effective specifically  the fact that some Member States have not yet adopted or have adopted only partially a system for the collection of separated waste  among Member States practising separated collection there are significant differences in the methods used so that a European citizen who is temporarily in an EU State other than his own may encounter problems  a very large number of products do not have information on their packaging so that citizens can identify how to dispose correctly of the packaging itself and the product once the products life is over  many products are highly over-packaged in relation to their contents and/or have packaging made up of different materials which are difficult to separate thus producing a surplus of waste that is difficult to dispose of.

30,With reference to Decision 1298/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and the Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013 Programme Guide the non-profit FISD Consortium  Integrated Higher Education in Design of Catanzaro recently launched a postgraduate training course. On 30 April 2010 it applied for funding under the Erasmus Mundus Call for Proposals 2010 with a project entitled reCity EMMC  FPA 2011-0181. It declared that the University of the Mediterranean UNIRC would be providing the courses on behalf of the consortium. The courses began and many young people invested resources and energy to attend them. However since March 2011 the UNIRC has no longer been participating in reCity activities and in May 2011 it suspended the Masters course on which the consortium meanwhile had continued to work together with its other partners and associates. The UNIRC has not yet paid students grants and neither has it reimbursed the advance payments given to it by the consortium breaching its obligations under the contract signed with the Agency on behalf of the consortium. The consortium in a majority vote decided to replace the course provider UNIRC with another member of the consortium albeit without excluding the UNIRC from the project. This was in order to ensure the smooth continuation of the activities approved by the Agency and to avert the danger of being declared liable with regard to the pre-contractual and  entered into with students the EACEA its partners and third parties. The request for approval sent to the Agency on 10 September 2011 under Section 4.5 of the 2009 to 2013 Guide was not accepted because it lacked the approval of the UNIRC the very body that was responsible for the breach of contract. The Agency asked the consortium to find a solution by 30 October 2011 stating that if it was unable to do so the five-year agreement could be terminated. The consortium therefore convened its governing body a meeting which the UNIRC was also supposed to attend once again and confirmed by a majority vote that the course provider would be replaced by another of the consortiums partners. It announced its decision to the Agency on 12 October 2011. Can the Commission say whether it considers the UNIRCs behaviour to be  with EU legislation on the implementation of the Erasmus Mundus programme and whether it intends to take any measures to prevent the serious social repercussions that would occur should the Agency fail to confirm the validity of the agreement signed with the consortium,P-010184/2011,0,With reference Decision EC European Parliament Council Erasmus Mundus Programme Guide nonprofit FISD Consortium Integrated Higher Education Design Catanzaro recently launched postgraduate training course On April applied funding Erasmus Mundus Call Proposals project entitled reCity EMMC FPA It declared University Mediterranean UNIRC would providing course behalf consortium The course began many young people invested resource energy attend However since March UNIRC longer participating reCity activity May suspended Masters course consortium meanwhile continued work together partner associate The UNIRC yet paid student grant neither reimbursed advance payment given consortium breaching obligation contract signed Agency behalf consortium The consortium majority vote decided replace course provider UNIRC another member consortium albeit without excluding UNIRC project This order ensure smooth continuation activity approved Agency avert danger declared liable regard precontractual entered student EACEA partner third party The request approval sent Agency September Section Guide accepted lacked approval UNIRC body responsible breach contract The Agency asked consortium find solution October stating unable fiveyear agreement could terminated The consortium therefore convened governing body meeting UNIRC also supposed attend confirmed majority vote course provider would replaced another consortium partner It announced decision Agency October Can Commission say whether considers UNIRCs behaviour EU legislation implementation Erasmus Mundus programme whether intends take measure prevent serious social repercussion would occur Agency fail confirm validity agreement signed consortium,PPE,Italy,With reference to Decision EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and the Erasmus Mundus Programme Guide the nonprofit FISD Consortium Integrated Higher Education in Design of Catanzaro recently launched a postgraduate training course On April it applied for funding under the Erasmus Mundus Call for Proposals with a project entitled reCity EMMC FPA It declared that the University of the Mediterranean UNIRC would be providing the course on behalf of the consortium The course began and many young people invested resource and energy to attend them However since March the UNIRC ha no longer been participating in reCity activity and in May it suspended the Masters course on which the consortium meanwhile had continued to work together with it other partner and associate The UNIRC ha not yet paid student grant and neither ha it reimbursed the advance payment given to it by the consortium breaching it obligation under the contract signed with the Agency on behalf of the consortium The consortium in a majority vote decided to replace the course provider UNIRC with another member of the consortium albeit without excluding the UNIRC from the project This wa in order to ensure the smooth continuation of the activity approved by the Agency and to avert the danger of being declared liable with regard to the precontractual and entered into with student the EACEA it partner and third party The request for approval sent to the Agency on September under Section of the to Guide wa not accepted because it lacked the approval of the UNIRC the very body that wa responsible for the breach of contract The Agency asked the consortium to find a solution by October stating that if it wa unable to do so the fiveyear agreement could be terminated The consortium therefore convened it governing body a meeting which the UNIRC wa also supposed to attend once again and confirmed by a majority vote that the course provider would be replaced by another of the consortium partner It announced it decision to the Agency on October Can the Commission say whether it considers the UNIRCs behaviour to be with EU legislation on the implementation of the Erasmus Mundus programme and whether it intends to take any measure to prevent the serious social repercussion that would occur should the Agency fail to confirm the validity of the agreement signed with the consortium,Erminia Mazzoni
179,The migration crisis that has intensified over the past few years and in particular within the last twelve months has produced an exodus of hundreds of thousands of people from North Africa and the Middle East fleeing hunger poverty persecution and war. The EU and its Member States cannot wash their hands of this humanitarian tragedy especially since their policies of meddling in and aggression against sovereign states in the regions concerned are one of the main causes of the exodus. In late January Brian Donald the Europol Chief of Staff was quoted in the media as saying that 10 000  children out of hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants had disappeared. The figures probably a conservative estimate apparently cover the last 18 months to two years.

More and more animals are being kept by fewer and fewer farmers in ever more  The industrialisation of agriculture with unnaturally high livestock population densities causes many problems suffering to animals emission of greenhouse gases impoverishment of the cultural landscape and the countryside pollution of groundwater and surface waters problems with the processing of manure including air pollution acidification and odour nuisance failure  with the European Nitrates Directive resistance to antibiotics in animals due to the systematic administration of antibiotics in feed etc. Stricter regulation in the Netherlands  where since 2013 provincial and municipal authorities have been empowered to limit the intensity of livestock farming and the size of livestock farms in an area  is accelerating the industrialisation of livestock farming in Flanders. In view of the cross-border problems the Commission ought to take steps to introduce European standards relating to the intensity of livestock farming and the size of livestock farms. The rules introduced should display respect for human beings the environment climate animals and the cultural landscape. 1.

1915,1. Is the Commission aware that the lengthy postponement of the opening of negotiations on Croatias accession to the EU which occurred in 2005 and the growing impression that new Member States will no longer be  to join within a few years which gained ground in 2006 have had a considerable impact on public opinion in Croatia as a result of which only 50  of the population now wish to join the EU and  unlike in the past  strikingly large numbers of young people rather than old are now opposed to the idea 2. Is the Commission aware that in Croatia people are gaining the impression that the EU is making the accession of new Member States conditional on establishing a free trade zone for the countries into which the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has disintegrated and that it is primarily seeking to gain influence for the EU over the states participating in the free trade zone without making it possible for those countries and their voters in the near future themselves to exercise influence over the EUs policy choices 3. Is the Commission aware that in this climate growing sections of public opinion are again turning away from what are seen as EUimposed values which is expressed in hostile acts against returning refugees belonging to ethnic minorities acts which the police cannot prevent and which  by people whom the police cannot trace because of the support which exists for them and in the again increasing sale of T-shirts bearing a portrait of the war criminal Gotovina who has been surrendered to the ICTY  by the slogan Gotovina Heroj 4.

291,The US navy has installed a Mobile User Objective System MUOS an ultra high frequency  system inside the Sughereta di Niscemi Niscemi cork forest nature reserve which is designated as a site of Community importance SCI code ITA050007 pursuant to the EU Habitats Directive. The 46 antennae at the naval radio transmitter facility NRTF pose a huge health risk to people living in the surrounding areas.

1537,In 2007 an Austrian nature protection organisation Alpenschutzverband submitted a petition to the European Parliament regarding the planned installation  without an environmental impact assessment EIA  of four new ski lifts in DamÊ_ls in Vorarlberg Austria. According to the petitioners  data had been supplied on the areas affected in order to avoid an EIA under Directive 85/337/EEC. They maintained that the project would have disastrous effects on the habitats of wild birds and mammals and on important biotopes in the area. They further claimed that the project had been deliberately subdivided into smaller projects that project elements had been deferred in time and that parts of projects had been cut down in size in order to keep the scope of development under the then applicable threshold 20 hectares. They maintained that the calculation should have included the entire area affected  not only those parts on which actual work was to be carried out and parts affected by landscape modification. The Committee on Petitions visited the Mellau/DamÊ_ls area on a fact-finding mission and approved the report on the mission. Does the Commission consider that the current EIA Directive contains sufficiently strict and appropriate requirements to prevent the splitting up or subdividing of projects over time or in terms of statutory type of construction as mentioned in Petition 0181/2009 or location If so does it consider that Austrias implementation of the directive  with the standards set in this respect Does the Commission consider it acceptable that only surfaces on which actual work is to be carried out should be included in calculations of area for EIA purposes Does the Commission consider it acceptable that ski slopes and surfaces on which no work is to be carried out but which are nonetheless part of the project should be excluded from the calculations for EIA purposes Does the Commission consider that in the case of the Mellau/DamÊ_ls project the requirement to take into account the cumulative and overall impact of the project has been fully met Can the Commission indicate the state of play with regard to the revision of the EIA Directive and whether the above-mentioned aspects will be taken into account in the revision,O-000084/2011,0,In Austrian nature protection organisation Alpenschutzverband submitted petition European Parliament regarding planned installation without environmental impact assessment EIA four new ski lift Dam Ê l Vorarlberg Austria According petitioner data supplied area affected order avoid EIA Directive EEC They maintained project would disastrous effect habitat wild bird mammal important biotopes area They claimed project deliberately subdivided smaller project project element deferred time part project cut size order keep scope development applicable threshold hectare They maintained calculation included entire area affected part actual work carried part affected landscape modification The Committee Petitions visited MellauDam Ê l area factfinding mission approved report mission Does Commission consider current EIA Directive contains sufficiently strict appropriate requirement prevent splitting subdividing project time term statutory type construction mentioned Petition location If consider Austrias implementation directive standard set respect Does Commission consider acceptable surface actual work carried included calculation area EIA purpose Does Commission consider acceptable ski slope surface work carried nonetheless part project excluded calculation EIA purpose Does Commission consider case MellauDam Ê l project requirement take account cumulative overall impact project fully met Can Commission indicate state play regard revision EIA Directive whether abovementioned aspect taken account revision,,Italy,In an Austrian nature protection organisation Alpenschutzverband submitted a petition to the European Parliament regarding the planned installation without an environmental impact assessment EIA of four new ski lift in Dam Ê l in Vorarlberg Austria According to the petitioner data had been supplied on the area affected in order to avoid an EIA under Directive EEC They maintained that the project would have disastrous effect on the habitat of wild bird and mammal and on important biotopes in the area They further claimed that the project had been deliberately subdivided into smaller project that project element had been deferred in time and that part of project had been cut down in size in order to keep the scope of development under the then applicable threshold hectare They maintained that the calculation should have included the entire area affected not only those part on which actual work wa to be carried out and part affected by landscape modification The Committee on Petitions visited the MellauDam Ê l area on a factfinding mission and approved the report on the mission Does the Commission consider that the current EIA Directive contains sufficiently strict and appropriate requirement to prevent the splitting up or subdividing of project over time or in term of statutory type of construction a mentioned in Petition or location If so doe it consider that Austrias implementation of the directive with the standard set in this respect Does the Commission consider it acceptable that only surface on which actual work is to be carried out should be included in calculation of area for EIA purpose Does the Commission consider it acceptable that ski slope and surface on which no work is to be carried out but which are nonetheless part of the project should be excluded from the calculation for EIA purpose Does the Commission consider that in the case of the MellauDam Ê l project the requirement to take into account the cumulative and overall impact of the project ha been fully met Can the Commission indicate the state of play with regard to the revision of the EIA Directive and whether the abovementioned aspect will be taken into account in the revision,Erminia Mazzoni

3193,There is a newly invented device that can make even barren land fertile. Inspired by the Namib Desert beetle an insect species capable of surviving in very dry areas by reusing the dew which collects on its back a young designer has developed a system called Airdrop. The device works by harnessing the phenomenon of evapotranspiration in which as a result of high temperatures water is made to pass from the ground into the air by  effect of transpiration through plants and direct evaporation from the soil. The Airdrop system is equipped with a turbine that drives air underground and cools it to reach 100  humidity. The water obtained is then stored in a tank and pumped to crop roots. Research by the inventor of Airdrop shows that in the most arid desert areas 11.5 ml of water can be harvested from every cubic metre of air.  Airdrop is a green system with a low environmental impact since it runs on wind and solar power.  The device could ensure that people living in dry areas would have better crops and hence the wherewithal to feed their families. Will the Commission consider publicising Airdrop in drought- and famine-prone areas in order to improve the quality of life for the people living there,E-012545/2011,0,There newly invented device make even barren land fertile Inspired Namib Desert beetle insect specie capable surviving dry area reusing dew collect back young designer developed system called Airdrop The device work harnessing phenomenon evapotranspiration result high temperature water made pas ground air effect transpiration plant direct evaporation soil The Airdrop system equipped turbine drive air underground cool reach humidity The water obtained stored tank pumped crop root Research inventor Airdrop show arid desert area ml water harvested every cubic metre air Airdrop green system low environmental impact since run wind solar power The device could ensure people living dry area would better crop hence wherewithal feed family Will Commission consider publicising Airdrop drought famineprone area order improve quality life people living,EFD,Italy,There is a newly invented device that can make even barren land fertile Inspired by the Namib Desert beetle an insect specie capable of surviving in very dry area by reusing the dew which collect on it back a young designer ha developed a system called Airdrop The device work by harnessing the phenomenon of evapotranspiration in which a a result of high temperature water is made to pas from the ground into the air by effect of transpiration through plant and direct evaporation from the soil The Airdrop system is equipped with a turbine that drive air underground and cool it to reach humidity The water obtained is then stored in a tank and pumped to crop root Research by the inventor of Airdrop show that in the most arid desert area ml of water can be harvested from every cubic metre of air Airdrop is a green system with a low environmental impact since it run on wind and solar power The device could ensure that people living in dry area would have better crop and hence the wherewithal to feed their family Will the Commission consider publicising Airdrop in drought and famineprone area in order to improve the quality of life for the people living there,Oreste Rossi

1697,1. Is the Commission aware that in Germany Ruhrgas AG distributes 58  of all natural gas in the country through its ownership of a pipeline network and imports and that Eon AG supplies almost one-third of the countrys electricity with the result that they hold a seriously dominant position in the two major sectors of the German energy market 2. Has the Commission been informed that a further concentration of control of German energy supplies with Ruhrgas AG being taken over by Eon AG was rejected in spring by the German equivalent of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission Kartellamt but that it may now go ahead because that decision was declared invalid by means of a Decree published on 5 July 2002 by Dr Alfred Tacke State Secretary for Economic Affairs on behalf of the German Government 3. Can the Commission confirm that in May the German Monopolies Commission also found the merger inadmissible unless a number of shares in other undertakings such as VNG in Leipzig were sold a sale which the German Government is now requiring of the undertakings to be merged 4. Is this approval of the merger despite fears of a misuse of power and domestic price increases largely based on efforts by the German Government to create a strong German concern which thanks to the EUs liberalisation of the market may acquire a significant market share in other EU Member States 5. Does the Commission take the view that this Decree might set a precedent Might it act as an incentive for the creation of more of these giant mergers at national level 6.

1457,Under current practice in the Emissions Trading System ETS Member States allocate 50 of their auction revenues to activities connected with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is the right approach as the resources stemming from a given countrys climate policy can be spent on climate objectives and the Member States have additional funding secured for climate protection measures. In connection with the expected loss of EU budget revenue when the UK leaves the Union Commissioner Oettinger proposes transferring national ETS auction receipts to the EU central budget. This will result in a reduction in the financial resources available to Member States to spend on climate objectives without  whatsoever which may lead to them cutting back on climate action. 1.

However the establishment  boards addresses the wrong issue. With euro area exports exceeding imports by more than 3 of GDP the euro area is not suffering from a lack  but from the private debt overhang inherited from a financial market-driven boom that went bust. Export is not the solution and squeezing wages will make matters worse by undermining internal demand and triggering deflation. Export market gains will eventually be neutralised by currency appreciation or by the weakening of the economies of the euro areas trading partners. The focus on  is short-sighted.

3025,The European Research Council ERC has been identified as the possible model for the potential establishment of the European Innovation Council. At the ERC the Identification Committee is responsible for identifying new members for the Scientific Council who are then appointed by the Commission. Although this Committee is supposed to be independent it appears that it is itself appointed by the Commission as are the Executive Agencys Director and the Steering Committee.

2871,Citizens of the SulcisIglesiente region of Sardinia are calling on the Commission to launch a regulatory intervention in the area. Pollution produced by industrial waste from the Portovesme site  in addition to causing an outbreak of tumours amongst the local population  has prompted the Sardinian healthcare system ASL 7 to prohibit all farming and cultivation activities in the municipality of Portoscuso. The nearby town of Gonnesa is equally at risk. A landfill for non-hazardous waste has been established in the Serra Scirieddus area with an authorisation to treat and store hazardous waste  containing chemical pollutants and heavy metals  from the landfills belonging to American aluminium producer Alcoa and the former  Alumix S.p.A. The old mining town of Gonnesa is located just 20 metres away from the landfill site along with a forest of pine trees. The valley below is host to numerous pastures and crops as well as a dam for harvesting rainwater to irrigate these fields which rainwater then flows into a stream crossing the whole town and eventually leading into the sea. The region is also part of the Geomineral Historic and Environmental Park of Sardinia. The  Riverso S.r.l. which specialises in the treatment of waste is responsible for environmental monitoring and  its findings to  authorities. Any other inspections carried out yearly are the responsibility of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency for Sardinia ARPAS. There are fears for the safety of the surrounding environment and populations given that entrusting these inspections to the very  that cause the pollution constitutes a clear conflict of interests.

2995,Alpine refuges which under Legislative Decree No 79 of 23 May 2011 are classified as being non-hotel  have recently been officially recognised as being equivalent to hotels and are thus required  with the relevant safety regulations by 6 October 2013. The work to be carried out in all Alpine refuges includes adjusting the size of the doors installing outward-opening anti-panic emergency doors updating firefighting equipment and installing new electrical systems and external staircases. The distinguishing feature of these facilities which are split into various categories according to their distance from the bottom of the valley and their difficulty of access is that of providing shelter and refuge to tourists mountain climbers and hikers in the mountains. In Veneto there are 142 such refuges. In the province of Belluno alone there are 35 of them 20 of which require work such as that described above for a total cost of over one million euro.

2743,In April 2012 a study published in Italy reveals that the Bank of Italy employed 6 970 people across the country. 35  of them were women and 22  of these held executive positions. This is an improvement from 2002 when women represented 28  of the 8 447 employees and 15  of executives. However women still account for fewer than half of the newly recruited graduates. Eurostat statistics confirm this trend the presence of women at higher levels is affected by socio-demographic factors. Over 80  of the Banks executives are in the 50 to 65 age range and are university educated. In this age range there are few female graduates and even fewer with specialisations in subjects that are relevant to the institutional functions of a central bank. Between 1998 and 2009 seven selection procedures were held for economic positions and six for lawyers in total there were 13 397 candidates 423 of whom were declared suitable. Women accounted for 61.5  of the candidates and only 35.5  of those declared suitable. The most able male candidates seem to take part in the pre-selection process but this is not the case for women. These differences are responsible for 40  of the gender disparity in  results while 34  are attributable to the effects of the same variables for example having a child aged under 14 is a disadvantage for women but not for men. The result reflects the asymmetry in domestic and family care work which is particularly marked in Italy. Around a quarter of the gap remains unexplained. This might signal the existence of the so-called implicit and indirect discrimination defined by the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU in which an employer involuntarily favours candidates belonging to a certain group despite the absence of any evidence showing they are better than others. Considering  the EUs objectives regarding equality between men and women which involve guaranteeing equal opportunity and equal pay for men and women and opposing any gender-based discrimination  the integration of the gender dimension which is one of the essential principles of EC law expressly approved by Articles 2 and 3 TEU Article 8 TFEU as well as the Womens Charter  relevant EC law Directive 2002/73/EC and Directive 2006/54/EC among others. Could the Commission   data and statistics for the ECB providing an average for the other European central banks  clarify if it intends to verify the correct transposition of the obligations into Italian law in view of the well-established interpretation by the CJEU  from the Defrenne II case to today  of the notion of indirect or implicit discrimination  IT C 203 E 17/07/2013,E-006558/2012,0,In April study published Italy reveals Bank Italy employed people across country woman held executive position This improvement woman represented employee executive However woman still account fewer half newly recruited graduate Eurostat statistic confirm trend presence woman higher level affected sociodemographic factor Over Banks executive age range university educated In age range female graduate even fewer specialisation subject relevant institutional function central bank Between seven selection procedure held economic position six lawyer total candidate declared suitable Women accounted candidate declared suitable The able male candidate seem take part preselection process case woman These difference responsible gender disparity result attributable effect variable example child aged disadvantage woman men The result reflects asymmetry domestic family care work particularly marked Italy Around quarter gap remains unexplained This might signal existence socalled implicit indirect discrimination defined Court Justice European Union CJEU employer involuntarily favour candidate belonging certain group despite absence evidence showing better others Considering EUs objective regarding equality men woman involve guaranteeing equal opportunity equal pay men woman opposing genderbased discrimination integration gender dimension one essential principle EC law expressly approved Articles TEU Article TFEU well Womens Charter relevant EC law Directive EC Directive EC among others Could Commission data statistic ECB providing average European central bank clarify intends verify correct transposition obligation Italian law view wellestablished interpretation CJEU Defrenne II case today notion indirect implicit discrimination IT C E,EFD,Italy,In April a study published in Italy reveals that the Bank of Italy employed people across the country of them were woman and of these held executive position This is an improvement from when woman represented of the employee and of executive However woman still account for fewer than half of the newly recruited graduate Eurostat statistic confirm this trend the presence of woman at higher level is affected by sociodemographic factor Over of the Banks executive are in the to age range and are university educated In this age range there are few female graduate and even fewer with specialisation in subject that are relevant to the institutional function of a central bank Between and seven selection procedure were held for economic position and six for lawyer in total there were candidate of whom were declared suitable Women accounted for of the candidate and only of those declared suitable The most able male candidate seem to take part in the preselection process but this is not the case for woman These difference are responsible for of the gender disparity in result while are attributable to the effect of the same variable for example having a child aged under is a disadvantage for woman but not for men The result reflects the asymmetry in domestic and family care work which is particularly marked in Italy Around a quarter of the gap remains unexplained This might signal the existence of the socalled implicit and indirect discrimination defined by the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU in which an employer involuntarily favour candidate belonging to a certain group despite the absence of any evidence showing they are better than others Considering the EUs objective regarding equality between men and woman which involve guaranteeing equal opportunity and equal pay for men and woman and opposing any genderbased discrimination the integration of the gender dimension which is one of the essential principle of EC law expressly approved by Articles and TEU Article TFEU a well a the Womens Charter relevant EC law Directive EC and Directive EC among others Could the Commission data and statistic for the ECB providing an average for the other European central bank clarify if it intends to verify the correct transposition of the obligation into Italian law in view of the wellestablished interpretation by the CJEU from the Defrenne II case to today of the notion of indirect or implicit discrimination IT C E,Oreste Rossi

1468,The Pero Spaccone district on the Formicoso plateau was identified by Decree Law No 90 of 23 May 2008 now Law No 123 of 14 July 2008 as a site for the disposal and provisional storage of waste for a period which has yet to be specified under the Campania regions waste disposal plan pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of Law No 123. The hydrogeological system of Avellino province is already under strong environmental pressure due to the presence of three large landfill sites whose location was chosen solely on the basis of local impact studies which fail to take account of the relief geology and hydrographic features of the territory as a whole and the impact of these landfill sites on aquifers. Nine kilometres away from the intended landfill site lies the 500 million cubic-metre-capacity artificial reservoir of Conza on the Ofanto river which will deliver to the Acquedotto Pugliese water supply network 1 m3 of water per second for human consumption. Under Decision No 96/4 of the Interministerial Planning Committee CIPE of 20 December 2004 water from the Conza reservoir will be treated to provide over 5 million people in Puglia with 32 million cubic metres of water per year. The water treatment plant is being financed by Acquedotto Pugliese and the Minister of the Economy at a cost of EUR 49 035 705 million. The contracts for the construction work have already been drawn up and the funds have already been allocated. There is an urgent need therefore for an environmental impact assessment of the landfill site taking into account the hydrodynamic implications of earthquake events and karst phenomena and the extremely impermeable nature of the soil which could result in pollutants from waste present on the surface being leached into the river Ofanto and the Conza reservoir. The fact that the reservoir is only 9 kilometres away and there are many streams torrents and wells which are unlikely to be monitored in any way increases the serious environmental risk due to the nature of the clay soil which means that any water which does not evaporate will end up in the reservoir. Decree Law 36/2003 requires the bottom of the landfill site to be at least two metres above the highest level of the water table with a safety margin of at least 10 metres and Decree Law 152/99 as subsequently amended strictly defines the safety zone as at least 400 metres from water captation points although the fact that there are at least 12 wells near the site designated for the dump is a clear indication of the existence of an aquifer. In view of the foregoing does the Commission agree that by virtue of its hydrographic and geological characteristics the Formicoso site should already have been excluded from the list of landfill sites Article 9 of Law No 123 of 14 July 2008 and a full environmental impact assessment must be carried out before a final decision is reached as to whether the site in question should be used for a

environmental pressure due to the presence of three large landfill site whose location wa chosen solely on the basis of local impact study which fail to take account of the relief geology and hydrographic feature of the territory a a whole and the impact of these landfill site on aquifer Nine kilometre away from the intended landfill site lie the million cubicmetrecapacity artificial reservoir of Conza on the Ofanto river which will deliver to the Acquedotto Pugliese water supply network m of water per second for human consumption Under Decision No of the Interministerial Planning Committee CIPE of December water from the Conza reservoir will be treated to provide over million people in Puglia with million cubic metre of water per year The water treatment plant is being financed by Acquedotto Pugliese and the Minister of the Economy at a cost of EUR million The contract for the construction work have already been drawn up and the fund have already been allocated There is an urgent need therefore for an environmental impact assessment of the landfill site taking into account the hydrodynamic implication of earthquake event and karst phenomenon and the extremely impermeable nature of the soil which could result in pollutant from waste present on the surface being leached into the river Ofanto and the Conza reservoir The fact that the reservoir is only kilometre away and there are many stream torrent and well which are unlikely to be monitored in any way increase the serious environmental risk due to the nature of the clay soil which mean that any water which doe not evaporate will end up in the reservoir Decree Law requires the bottom of the landfill site to be at least two metre above the highest level of the water table with a safety margin of at least metre and Decree Law a subsequently amended strictly defines the safety zone a at least metre from water captation point although the fact that there are at least well near the site designated for the dump is a clear indication of the existence of an aquifer In view of the foregoing doe the Commission agree that by virtue of it hydrographic and geological characteristic the Formicoso site should already have been excluded from the list of landfill site Article of Law No of July and a full environmental impact assessment must be carried out before a final decision is reached a to whether the site in question should be used for a waste tip,Roberto Musacchio

1461,The European aluminium-processing industry has long been calling for a reduction in the present rate of import duties of 6 on primary aluminium. An official request has been submitted by the United Kingdom for the existing rate to be halved. The European Union is two-thirds dependent for its supplies on imports from third countries. At the same time demand for and use of aluminium in the EU is rising continuously. An import duty of 6 consequently can no longer be economically justified. The European processing industry and the consumer are the losers under this provision. Does the Commission consider that the EU import levy on aluminium can still be justified Does the Commission not think that it would be well advised in the light of the above factors to take the initiative by itself submitting a proposal for these import duties to be lowered,H-0423/01,0,The European aluminiumprocessing industry long calling reduction present rate import duty primary aluminium An official request submitted United Kingdom existing rate halved The European Union twothirds dependent supply import third country At time demand use aluminium EU rising continuously An import duty consequently longer economically justified The European processing industry consumer loser provision Does Commission consider EU import levy aluminium still justified Does Commission think would well advised light factor take initiative submitting proposal import duty lowered,,Belgium,The European aluminiumprocessing industry ha long been calling for a reduction in the present rate of import duty of on primary aluminium An official request ha been submitted by the United Kingdom for the existing rate to be halved The European Union is twothirds dependent for it supply on import from third country At the same time demand for and use of aluminium in the EU is rising continuously An import duty of consequently can no longer be economically justified The European processing industry and the consumer are the loser under this provision Does the Commission consider that the EU import levy on aluminium can still be justified Does the Commission not think that it would be well advised in the light of the above factor to take the initiative by itself submitting a proposal for these import duty to be lowered,Dirk Sterckx
1814,Fishing quotas for Lithuania are so low that  may have a profit from a maximum of 25 ships all others have to be sawn up as not profitable. Last year in Lithuania 20 fishing ships were sawn up this year at least 11 ships. Therefore Lithuania at the moment has only 34 fishing ships in its fleet and obviously the process of sawing up ships will continue next year. Even though the EU pays more than 1 million litas for each sawn up ship as a consequence of the low fishing quotas the Lithuanian fleet navy will be destroyed.

805,The Internet has  the foremost utility for the promotion of organisations and the dissemination of information. The Internet has allowed nations from across the world to signpost their websites  from that nation. The European Commission has recently been allocated a top-level domain of .eu which it has selected the EURid organisation to administer. There is now therefore the opportunity to create second-level domains for all the languages that are used in the 25 Member States of the EU. When a country is allocated a top-level domain it is given its two-letter code based on its two-letter code in ISO 31661. In keeping with that the codes that could be allocated to a  second-level domain of .eu could feasibly be based on the Alpha3 language codes in ISO 639.

295,On Thursday 18 October 2018 the Kosovo Parliament adopted three laws relating to the creation of a Kosovo army with 98 of the 120 deputies voting for the proposal. The 11 deputies representing the Serb minority in Kosovo boycotted the vote. The laws would expand the mandate of the Kosovo Security Force which is made up of some 5 000 soldiers and is only permitted to perform civil protection work and carry light weapons. The NATO-US alliance which has 4 000 troops in Kosovo had made the creation of a Kosovo army dependent on support from the Serb minority in Kosovo.

1660,Presidential and local elections were held in Bulgaria on 23 October 2011. In order to ensure that Bulgarians living in Serbia could exercise their right to vote the Bulgarian authorities asked the Serbian Government whether polling stations could be opened at Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad since under Bulgarian electoral law polling stations can only be opened abroad with the express consent of the host state. Unfortunately Serbia did not grant the necessary permission for voting to take place in the towns concerned meaning that the large Bulgarian minority in Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad had to go to Belgrade to vote in the Bulgarian Presidential elections. For financial reasons many of the Bulgarians living on the western border were unable to travel and to exercise their right to vote. Hence by refusing to open polling stations in Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad the Serbian authorities were instrumental in limiting the political rights of the Bulgarian minority. Moreover their refusal to open polling stations in Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad was unjustified as similar polling stations had been opened there for the general elections in 2005 and 2009. As a country attempting to secure EU candidate status Serbia should not only ensure that a legal framework exists to safeguard the rights of minorities but also apply that framework in practice. In the light of the above can the Commission state 1. Whether it considers that by refusing to open polling stations in Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad Serbia has not violated the political rights of the Bulgarian minority and in particular its right to vote in the Bulgarian presidential election held on 23 October 2011 2.

1615,The terrorist attacks in Mumbai India which hit mainline and underground railway stations left 160 people dead and more than 500 injured according to what are still unfortunately provisional figures. These tragic events caused by terrorism have also hit one of the most developed Asian countries and it is thought that those responsible may be Muslim separatists from Kashmir linked to Lashkar-i-Taiba the Islamic terrorist group generally considered to be the armed wing of Osama Bin Laden in Asia.

1157,According to an article in the New Scientist of 25 October 1997 Japanese scientists have discovered a substance known as 3-nitrobenzanthrone which has a highly mutagenic effect. It is released in extremely small concentrations from diesel engines but appears to have a highly carcinogenic effect. It causes one quarter more mutations of bacterial DNA than the next most mutagenic substance. It is apparently released when diesel engines in lorries are heavily loaded.

93,The veal sector in Europe is of great importance for managing the market in the beef sector. If fewer calves are used in the calf sector this leads to additional production of beef. The importance of this factor has increased with the BSE crisis. The objective of the early marketing premium which was introduced for beef calves is to use more calves in the longer term in the calf sector. However the short-term effect of this premium is a temporary increase of the supply of veal on the EU market. Consequently the market price for veal is in a state of free fall and there is a crisis in the European veal sector. 1. Is the Commission aware of this temporary crisis with a shrinking calf sector and the effect it has on the beef and veal sector resulting 2. How does the Commission intend preventing the situation in the calf sector resulting in a reaction to foreign veal on the part of producers in importing countries such as the action taken in France in December 1996 in response to veal from the Netherlands 3.

3221,A few weeks ago it was announced that extensive fumigation is to be carried out in Galicia with Cascade a product whose active principle is flufenoxuron in order__ infestation by gonipterus scutellatus eucalyptus snout beetle in 100 000 hectares of eucalyptus plantation.. The fumigation calls for 50 000 litres of dilute flufenoxuron. Under Regulation EU No 942/2011 of 22 September 2011 this chemical has been banned by 31 December 2011 at the latest although Member States are allowed a grace period under the terms of Article 46 of Regulation EC No 1107/2009 for the disposal storage placing on the market and use of existing stocks where the reasons for withdrawal amendment or non-renewal of the authorisation are not related to the protection of human and animal health. Numerous studies show the use of this neurotoxin to be inadvisable due to its harmful impact on plant and animal life as well as on human health. It is particularly linked with the disappearance of large numbers of bees in Galicia in some areas amounting to 80__ of bee colonies raising the threat of their extinction in this region. As bees are responsible for pollinating agricultural crops this could lead to the collapse of agriculture according to the FAO 80__ of cultivated plants are pollinated by bees and 76__ of human food depends on their presence. Einstein himself warned that the survival of the human species depends on bees. Furthermore aerial pesticide spraying results in up to 60__ of the agrotoxins dispersed falling outside their target area over a distance of several kilometres affecting natural areas drinking water crops and even animal species such as arthropods. There have also been cases of flufenoxuron poisoning in humans. It is classified as a substance which is potentially harmful to breast-feeding babies and dangerous to the aquatic environment. In addition to this proposed fumigation four pesticide brands containing flufenoxuron as their active ingredient are still authorised for sale in Spain.

1764,Some types of clam such as Arousa rapotudas or Redondela trompudas in Galicia grow breadthwise instead of lengthwise  fatter in the shell. They  convex rather than lengthening to the required minimum of 35 mm and die before reaching that size. In Italy the minimum size for Chamelea gallina clams is 25 mm though several scientific studies show that this type of clam reaches sexual maturity at between 13 and 18 mm. In both cases studies point to a substrate issue. Meanwhile the Italians are cooking bivalves imported from Turkey where the minimum permitted size is 17 mm.

In 2016 34.5 of the population in the 15-75 age bracket smoked tobacco 83 of whom did so daily which is a much higher proportion than in neighbouring countries. In France smoking is the direct cause of 73 000 deaths each year.

642,When the 2013 CAP reform came in the Crisis Reserve was established to be financed annually by reducing direct payments through financial discipline. Funds not used for crisis measures should be returned to farmers in the following year. Financial discipline reduction has happened every year since 2013 and last year the reduction was 1.393041. The Commission confirmed this week that in order to ensure that the crisis reserve of EUR 450.5 million was still available it would be necessary to reduce direct payments exceeding EUR 2 000 by 1.366744 in 2017. Following the Agricultural Council meeting of 14 March 2016 it was decided that activation of the crisis reserve is a last resort and will be avoided to ensure its maintenance. While no-one can take issue with the financial discipline mechanism in itself as an economic mechanism for anticipating budgetary problems before they arise the reasons cited by the Commissioner for this reduction are contradictory at a time when farmers are facing a real crisis and have been denied any access to the crisis reserve.

1373,Germany stands accused of  with other European states through excessively low wage levels thus fuelling the euro crisis. It is claimed that this has weakened German demand for Italian pasta and Greek olive oil for example while making German exports so cheap that the industrial sector in the southern states of the euro area could not possibly survive in the domestic market. In its latest report the International Monetary Fund has even called on Germany to bring its wage levels into line with those of France and Italy. However a study carried out by the German Institute for Economic Research  to the conclusion that the unit cost of labour has not developed more slowly than the euro area average and that Germanys exports to the euro area have hardly changed since the introduction of the euro. Following stagnation between 2001 and 2007 German businesses only started to sell more to Europe in the years following the outbreak of the crisis. The German export miracle took place exclusively beyond Europes borders. The other members of the euro area have also enjoyed the benefits of the German boom. The conclusion drawn is that Germany has not in fact profited from the introduction of the euro at all and that German industry could not possibly drive undertakings in other euro area Member States out of business as it was in no stronger position in the past. 1.

1488,The municipal authorities of San Fernando de Henares Madrid Community which is close to Madrid-Barajas airport have  that local residents are subjected to high noise levels. The continual overhead passage of aircraft causes peak noise levels of over 90 decibels. There are also a large number of irregular flights particularly night flights from runway 15-R-33-L which are expressly forbidden by the airports own rules. The planes fly over the town at a height of 600 metres disrupting the residents quality of life and with an attendant risk of accidents. It would also appear that the airports south configuration is being incorrectly used regardless of permitted weather conditions which would imply an infringement of aeronautical and airport rules.

2097,On 26 March 2010 the European Council endorsed the broad lines of the Europe 2020 strategy the object of which is to lay the foundations for the economic and political revitalisation of the EU. The Commission is preparing to publish its ideas on economic social and territorial cohesion and the future structure of the Community budget. One way to promote regional development in Europe lies in the use of the ESF which has to play a key role not least in outlying maritime regions where the problems of employment training and social inclusion have been aggravated by the current economic and financial crisis. 1.

2443,This question arises from an actual case which occurred on the weekend following the New Year 2002. A number of Swedish families were travelling by coach from Yugoslavia to Sweden with a  Espergerde Bussfart AS. The coach started about 8 a.m. on the Friday in southern Serbia picked up passengers in Belgrade and other places and then travelled from Yugoslavia through Hungary Austria Germany and Denmark to Sweden. There were no major customs checks throughout the trip until the coach was leaving Germany at Rostock. It arrived about 11 on the Sunday morning and was one of four coaches pulled in for a search. The search lasted six hours and all the passengers most of them families some with small children were ordered out into the cold to stand with their luggage in a long queue in front of the customs officials dressed up  gear. All the baggage and the coach were subjected to a rigorous search. After six hours the coach was released after six or seven excess bottles of alcohol and about the same number of cartons of cigarettes had been found among these not very wealthy travellers long distance coach travel being a low budget option for which fines of 44 euros per item were charged. The coach arrived at 6 p.m. at Gedser only to find the Danish customs waiting. They began an equally exhaustive search with a new enforced wait and an extended check involving body searches and the use of dogs. The passengers were thus detained for 12 hours in EU countries. How long may people be detained by the customs authorities  during police custody a person is entitled to call in legal assistance and may not be detained for long periods without good reason. Would not one exhaustive search in one country be enough or should the customs be able to conduct search after search in one country after the other on the same coach and the same passengers for hours and hours and days and days without sustenance or rest,E-0422/02,0,This question arises actual case occurred weekend following New Year A number Swedish family travelling coach Yugoslavia Sweden Espergerde Bussfart AS The coach started Friday southern Serbia picked passenger Belgrade place travelled Yugoslavia Hungary Austria Germany Denmark Sweden There major custom check throughout trip coach leaving Germany Rostock It arrived Sunday morning one four coach pulled search The search lasted six hour passenger family small child ordered cold stand luggage long queue front custom official dressed gear All baggage coach subjected rigorous search After six hour coach released six seven excess bottle alcohol number carton cigarette found among wealthy traveller long distance coach travel low budget option fine euro per item charged The coach arrived pm Gedser find Danish custom waiting They began equally exhaustive search new enforced wait extended check involving body search use dog The passenger thus detained hour EU country How long may people detained custom authority police custody person entitled call legal assistance may detained long period without good reason Would one exhaustive search one country enough custom able conduct search search one country coach passenger hour hour day day without sustenance rest,GUE/NGL,Sweden,This question arises from an actual case which occurred on the weekend following the New Year A number of Swedish family were travelling by coach from Yugoslavia to Sweden with a Espergerde Bussfart AS The coach started about am on the Friday in southern Serbia picked up passenger in Belgrade and other place and then travelled from Yugoslavia through Hungary Austria Germany and Denmark to Sweden There were no major custom check throughout the trip until the coach wa leaving Germany at Rostock It arrived about on the Sunday morning and wa one of four coach pulled in for a search The search lasted six hour and all the passenger most of them family some with small child were ordered out into the cold to stand with their luggage in a long queue in front of the custom official dressed up gear All the baggage and the coach were subjected to a rigorous search After six hour the coach wa released after six or seven excess bottle of alcohol and about the same number of carton of cigarette had been found among these not very wealthy traveller long distance coach travel being a low budget option for which fine of euro per item were charged The coach arrived at pm at Gedser only to find the Danish custom waiting They began an equally exhaustive search with a new enforced wait and an extended check involving body search and the use of dog The passenger were thus detained for hour in EU country How long may people be detained by the custom authority during police custody a person is entitled to call in legal assistance and may not be detained for long period without good reason Would not one exhaustive search in one country be enough or should the custom be able to conduct search after search in one country after the other on the same coach and the same passenger for hour and hour and day and day without sustenance or rest,Jonas Sjöstedt
1067,In its issue of 5-11 September 2004 the newspaper New Europe reports that the President of the Commission Mr Prodi convened a meeting at the end of last July with the Commission Directors-General involved in the construction of the Eleftherios Venizelos airport in Athens in an attempt - reportedly - to close the Spata dossier before he returns to Italy because the entire situation as it stands is a godsend to the Italian Prime Minister Mr Berlusconi the implication being that the situation could be exploited politically in the  Italian elections when Mr Prodi and Mr Berlusconi will be opposing each other. It is pointed out that the former British MEP Mr Khanbai together with Mrs Stauner of Germany and Mr Blak of Denmark asked the Commission for the documents relating to the construction of the airport but Mr Prodi answered in May 2003 as the same newspaper reports that they could not be made available as the contract contained financial and technical information the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the interests of the parties involved.

1022,Spains coal industry is in dire straits. The situation has been made worse by the uncertainty surrounding the  expiry of Regulation EC No 1407/20021 on state aid to the coal industry and the publication on 20 July 2010 of the proposal for a regulation on state aid to facilitate the closure of  coal mines. The coal industry accounts for more than 10 000 direct jobs and 30 000 indirect jobs in the north-west of Spain especially in the regions of Aragon Asturias and Castilla y LeÊ_n. The people in these areas are gravely concerned by the publication of the new proposal. Closing the mines would have disastrous social consequences in a country with the highest employment figures in the EU. Meanwhile the Spanish Cabinet has adopted a Royal Decree on national coal which is needed to fulfil the aims of the National Coal Mining Plan for 200612. That Decree cannot be implemented however as it has not been approved by the Commission. Bearing these points in mind Does the Commission agree that in these circumstances it is vital that the College of Commissioners should approve the Royal Decree on national coal as soon as possible Does the Commission take the view that coal is of strategic value in that it is the sole national source of energy for Member States like Spain Germany Romania and Poland Does the Commission agree that the European Union should ensure that coal mining continues with  the development of renewable sources of energy in providing vital energy self-sufficiency for these Member States Does the Commission not think that there is a need for a new coal industry regulation laying down measures such as the introduction of a quota according to which 10  of electricity is produced by thermal power stations that use national coal,E-7424/2010,0,Spains coal industry dire strait The situation made worse uncertainty surrounding expiry Regulation EC No state aid coal industry publication July proposal regulation state aid facilitate closure coal mine The coal industry account direct job indirect job northwest Spain especially region Aragon Asturias Castilla Le Ê n The people area gravely concerned publication new proposal Closing mine would disastrous social consequence country highest employment figure EU Meanwhile Spanish Cabinet adopted Royal Decree national coal needed fulfil aim National Coal Mining Plan That Decree cannot implemented however approved Commission Bearing point mind Does Commission agree circumstance vital College Commissioners approve Royal Decree national coal soon possible Does Commission take view coal strategic value sole national source energy Member States like Spain Germany Romania Poland Does Commission agree European Union ensure coal mining continues development renewable source energy providing vital energy selfsufficiency Member States Does Commission think need new coal industry regulation laying measure introduction quota according electricity produced thermal power station use national coal,GUE/NGL,Spain,Spains coal industry is in dire strait The situation ha been made worse by the uncertainty surrounding the expiry of Regulation EC No on state aid to the coal industry and the publication on July of the proposal for a regulation on state aid to facilitate the closure of coal mine The coal industry account for more than direct job and indirect job in the northwest of Spain especially in the region of Aragon Asturias and Castilla y Le Ê n The people in these area are gravely concerned by the publication of the new proposal Closing the mine would have disastrous social consequence in a country with the highest employment figure in the EU Meanwhile the Spanish Cabinet ha adopted a Royal Decree on national coal which is needed to fulfil the aim of the National Coal Mining Plan for That Decree cannot be implemented however a it ha not been approved by the Commission Bearing these point in mind Does the Commission agree that in these circumstance it is vital that the College of Commissioners should approve the Royal Decree on national coal a soon a possible Does the Commission take the view that coal is of strategic value in that it is the sole national source of energy for Member States like Spain Germany Romania and Poland Does the Commission agree that the European Union should ensure that coal mining continues with the development of renewable source of energy in providing vital energy selfsufficiency for these Member States Does the Commission not think that there is a need for a new coal industry regulation laying down measure such a the introduction of a quota according to which of electricity is produced by thermal power station that use national coal,Willy Meyer
457,On 30 January 2015 the Spanish Council of Ministers approved the Royal Decree reforming the university system. This latest reform allows Spanish universities to choose their preferred arrangement three years for a first degree and two years for a masters degree 32 or four years for a first degree and one year for a masters degree 41. The Conference of Spanish University Rectors CRUE rejects this reform citing how unwise it is to change a system when the first generations of the Bologna Plan are only just finishing their studies and there are still some students following the previous system. In turn the students and university lecturers unions are warning about the decrease in equal opportunities for access to studies for some students because of the increased cost involved in a two-year masters degree in a country especially affected by the economic crisis. The result is a breaking-up or deregulation of the university system whereby each university sets the number of credits of its qualifications thereby violating the principle of legal certainty. On the basis of the foregoing does the Commission not consider that the deregulation of the university system and the possible increase in cost for many students may jeopardise the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives,E-004779-15,0,On January Spanish Council Ministers approved Royal Decree reforming university system This latest reform allows Spanish university choose preferred arrangement three year first degree two year master degree four year first degree one year master degree The Conference Spanish University Rectors CRUE reject reform citing unwise change system first generation Bologna Plan finishing study still student following previous system In turn student university lecturer union warning decrease equal opportunity access study student increased cost involved twoyear master degree country especially affected economic crisis The result breakingup deregulation university system whereby university set number credit qualification thereby violating principle legal certainty On basis foregoing Commission consider deregulation university system possible increase cost many student may jeopardise achievement Europe strategy objective,ALDE,Spain,On January the Spanish Council of Ministers approved the Royal Decree reforming the university system This latest reform allows Spanish university to choose their preferred arrangement three year for a first degree and two year for a master degree or four year for a first degree and one year for a master degree The Conference of Spanish University Rectors CRUE reject this reform citing how unwise it is to change a system when the first generation of the Bologna Plan are only just finishing their study and there are still some student following the previous system In turn the student and university lecturer union are warning about the decrease in equal opportunity for access to study for some student because of the increased cost involved in a twoyear master degree in a country especially affected by the economic crisis The result is a breakingup or deregulation of the university system whereby each university set the number of credit of it qualification thereby violating the principle of legal certainty On the basis of the foregoing doe the Commission not consider that the deregulation of the university system and the possible increase in cost for many student may jeopardise the achievement of the Europe strategy objective,Maite Pagazaurtundúa Ruiz

670,Greece has 4.5 billion tonnes of lignite reserves worth between EUR 13 and 14 per tonne. On the basis of the Greek mining code lignite should normally be auctioned. In the 1970s the Greek State gave the DEI the right to exploit the lignite free of charge and when the DEI became a  in 2001 it retained this right on the basis of previous concessions most of which will expire between 2018 until 2026.

325,There have been many articles during the last few days about the torture of waterboarding. Regardless of what motivated these publications we need to examine the whole issue for the following reasons In waterboarding the victim is immobilised on his back with his head down. After placing a towel on the face of the victim the torturer pours water into his nose and mouth. This triggers an immediate reflex in the victim that can cause pain and damage to the lungs. It can also cause brain damage from oxygen deprivation and other physical injuries including broken bones because of the victims efforts to escape the torture. Despite the horror of this form of torture many people are subjected to it. Today there are even people who say they did not hesitate to give the green light to use waterboarding since as they say they do not consider it as torture but categorize it rather as an enhanced interrogation technique by which they can obtain important information.

393,According to a report by M?decins Sans Fronti?res MSF more than 350 000 earthquake survivors are still being housed in camps in Port-au-Prince. Thousands of people are living in shanty towns where sanitary conditions remain deplorable and the risk of being infected with cholera is extremely high. Since October 2010 the disease has infected approximately 600 000 Haitians roughly six per cent of the countrys population and has killed more than 7 500 people. Haitians no longer have the resources to put in place appropriate standards of hygiene. Since the start of the year more than 12 000 patients have been treated in five cholera treatment centres CTCs run by MSF in Port-au-Prince and L?og?ne. This is a  with the same period in 2011 but given that there are around 250 new cases each week this is still a high number. The overall situation is  by another problem the work of humanitarian agencies is being impeded due to reduced international funding. MSF maintains that as long as cholera prevention and treatment measures remain inadequate it will still take a long time to eradicate the disease. A further issue is the slow response capability of the Ministry of Health. As a result during the most recent spike of new cases in May MSF treated more than 70  of patients registered in Port-au-Prince. Cholera is an easily treatable disease but it is crucial that specialised treatment centres are made accessible and that patients are brought to them as soon the first symptoms appear. Simple measures are all that are needed to integrate cholera treatment into the services provided by Haitis healthcare facilities.

A lack of  and in parallel with the closure of the SSIS a failure to launch new training courses has forced individual schools to employ unqualified teachers to teach subjects for which no qualified teachers are available. Specifically for this special category of teachers who although not qualified have worked for some years in schools a so-called special TFA has been launched by amending the Ministerial Decree No 249/2010. Today teachers must pay to gain access to the TFA the average cost of the enrolment fees is between EUR 2 000 and EUR 3 000 per year which has transformed these courses into a tax on mandatory training imposed by the State. Access to the special TFA is only available to unqualified teachers thus excluding tenured teachers with specific teaching hours.

3238,One of the main issues on the table in the secret Free Trade Agreement negotiations which are currently taking place between the USA and the EU is the need to establish regulatory coherence between the two regions. In 2013 a leaked document on the state of the negotiations demonstrated that both entities want to introduce procedures to strengthen regulatory cooperation i.e. instruments that would enable existing regulations on areas such as environmental protection public health and agrifood standards to be repealed or watered down. There is every indication that the Commission and the US authorities are taking this approach in an attempt to avoid criticism and majority opposition to negotiations that could lead to a considerable deterioration on matters as relevant as current EU restrictions on genetically modified organisms and the precautionary principle for example. Can the Commission tell us how far the negotiations on regulatory cohesion have progressed Does it not think that instruments such  procedures regulatory cooperation the dilution  impact and the setting-up of a Regulatory Council are a direct attack on the principles of democracy and Member States sovereignty as they will result in legislation being put at the service of multinationals rather than the general interest,E-010536-14,0,One main issue table secret Free Trade Agreement negotiation currently taking place USA EU need establish regulatory coherence two region In leaked document state negotiation demonstrated entity want introduce procedure strengthen regulatory cooperation ie instrument would enable existing regulation area environmental protection public health agrifood standard repealed watered There every indication Commission US authority taking approach attempt avoid criticism majority opposition negotiation could lead considerable deterioration matter relevant current EU restriction genetically modified organism precautionary principle example Can Commission tell u far negotiation regulatory cohesion progressed Does think instrument procedure regulatory cooperation dilution impact settingup Regulatory Council direct attack principle democracy Member States sovereignty result legislation put service multinationals rather general interest,GUE/NGL,Spain,One of the main issue on the table in the secret Free Trade Agreement negotiation which are currently taking place between the USA and the EU is the need to establish regulatory coherence between the two region In a leaked document on the state of the negotiation demonstrated that both entity want to introduce procedure to strengthen regulatory cooperation ie instrument that would enable existing regulation on area such a environmental protection public health and agrifood standard to be repealed or watered down There is every indication that the Commission and the US authority are taking this approach in an attempt to avoid criticism and majority opposition to negotiation that could lead to a considerable deterioration on matter a relevant a current EU restriction on genetically modified organism and the precautionary principle for example Can the Commission tell u how far the negotiation on regulatory cohesion have progressed Does it not think that instrument such procedure regulatory cooperation the dilution impact and the settingup of a Regulatory Council are a direct attack on the principle of democracy and Member States sovereignty a they will result in legislation being put at the service of multinationals rather than the general interest,Marina Albiol Guzmán
2862,The Turkish Government has recently issued eight notices to airmen NOTAMs intended for Athens once more racking up tension between the two countries and necessitating an immediate response by Greece.

1847,Turkmenistan has developed into a harsh dictatorship in which the political opposition is systematically repressed. Even relatives and friends of opposition figures are punished with imprisonment torture and internal exile. One example of such repression is the reprisals suffered by the relatives of Sapar Yklimov. Sapar Yklimov was previously forced to leave Turkmenistan because of his criticism of the dictatorship in the country. He now lives in Sweden and is a Swedish citizen.

3442,The American multinational ENRON wants to build an 800 megawatt natural gas and diesel oil power plant on the outskirts of Tordesillas which according to data supplied by  will release 2 540 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide the main cause of climate change 2 100 tonnes of nitrogen oxides 191 tonnes of sulphur dioxide 545 tonnes of carbon monoxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year. This project is being planned in an Autonomous Region which produces three times more electricity than it consumes. It is therefore obviously already producing a surplus. The plant would be located only 2 kilometres from Tordesillas a town with 8 000 inhabitants and 5 km from the only protected natural area in the province of Valladolid - the Riberas de Castronuno nature reserve - and only a few kilometres from the vineyards producing wine under the registered designation of origin Rueda. According to the proposal presented by  the volume of water from the river Duero needed to cool the power plant 042 m3/s will seriously upset the rivers ecosystem since some years the volume during the low-water period is only 3 m3/s and barely covers its ecological flow. This will inevitably cause serious damage to the wetlands of Riberas de CastronuÊ±o which is classified as a nature reserve. In view of its environmental importance particularly for birds part of this area has been declared a special bird protection zone which it is proposed to include in the Natura 2000 network.

2347,Article 61 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC requires the Member States to establish the necessary conservation measures to avoid in the special areas of conservation the deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species as well as disturbance of the species for which the areas have been designated in accordance with Article 62 and 3. The Danish nature conservancy agency Naturstyrelsen which represents the Danish authorities in this area recently submitted the Natura 2000 plans with a view  with the EUs nature conservancy directives in particular the Habitats Directive. However it emerges that the technical basis for plans in a number of areas is inadequate and defective in the light of the directives requirements. That has been pointed out by several organisations with no links to each other which have made submissions at hearings in connection with the process of adopting the Natura 2000 plans. The submissions point in particular to the fact that out-of-date figures have been used and that the plans contain insufficient details. The Word Wide Fund for Nature points out in this connection that in many cases given the current threats the objectives and guidelines in the nature conservancy plans are too imprecise and inadequate while the Danish Ornithological Association concludes that the plans flaws and  obviously need to be rectified if the nature conservancy plans are to have the intended effect. The Danish Nature Conservancy Association criticism is that in general the knowledge base of the proposals drawn up is clearly deficient. Throughout the process according to the association surveillance and monitoring and in general knowledge-gathering in connection with habitats and species have been embarrassing. The Commission has previously issued a reasoned opinion in connection with Denmarks failure to implement Article 62 and 3 properly.

2016,The MWL consultancy firm hired within the framework of the Cohesion Fund to draw up a report on the hydrological situation in Spain and Portugal states on page 13 of the Spanish version of the publication issued by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities that in order to correct the shortages amongst catchment areas caused by the irregular seasonal and spatial distribution of water in Spain transfers between catchment areas should be considered the most stable and suitable solution. Likewise according to the main findings on page 15 the research points to the feasibility of building up resources through increased regulation of the flow of water in rivers and the transfer of excess water from northern Spain to the south and east of the country. To cite the last of many possible examples the section dealing with potential improvements on page 19 puts forward two main courses of action to correct the shortages in some catchment areas including redistributing water between them by means of transfers and goes on to say that the only real feasible means of resolving the problems affecting those catchment areas in which water is in short supply is to carry out works designed to transfer resources. The said transfers would affect the Norte-Duero and Ebro rivers and in the latter instance would involve the transfer of 1 855 hm3. The documentation used by MWL and contained in the aforementioned publication was produced by the then socialist government. However since 1996 another party has been in power in Spain. Bearing this in mind - does the Commission agree with the statements made by MWL in the publication on the need to transfer water from the Ebro catchment area If so does it believe that the Cohesion Fund would serve as a suitable financial instrument for that purpose - has the current Spanish Government made the Commission aware of its views on the statements and proposals contained in the MWL report on the feasibility of transfers from the River Ebro to other catchment areas and on possible financing arrangements,E-0273/99,0,The MWL consultancy firm hired within framework Cohesion Fund draw report hydrological situation Spain Portugal state page Spanish version publication issued Office Official Publications European Communities order correct shortage amongst catchment area caused irregular seasonal spatial distribution water Spain transfer catchment area considered stable suitable solution Likewise according main finding page research point feasibility building resource increased regulation flow water river transfer excess water northern Spain south east country To cite last many possible example section dealing potential improvement page put forward two main course action correct shortage catchment area including redistributing water mean transfer go say real feasible mean resolving problem affecting catchment area water short supply carry work designed transfer resource The said transfer would affect NorteDuero Ebro river latter instance would involve transfer hm The documentation used MWL contained aforementioned publication produced socialist government However since another party power Spain Bearing mind Commission agree statement made MWL publication need transfer water Ebro catchment area If believe Cohesion Fund would serve suitable financial instrument purpose current Spanish Government made Commission aware view statement proposal contained MWL report feasibility transfer River Ebro catchment area possible financing arrangement,ARE,Spain,The MWL consultancy firm hired within the framework of the Cohesion Fund to draw up a report on the hydrological situation in Spain and Portugal state on page of the Spanish version of the publication issued by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities that in order to correct the shortage amongst catchment area caused by the irregular seasonal and spatial distribution of water in Spain transfer between catchment area should be considered the most stable and suitable solution Likewise according to the main finding on page the research point to the feasibility of building up resource through increased regulation of the flow of water in river and the transfer of excess water from northern Spain to the south and east of the country To cite the last of many possible example the section dealing with potential improvement on page put forward two main course of action to correct the shortage in some catchment area including redistributing water between them by mean of transfer and go on to say that the only real feasible mean of resolving the problem affecting those catchment area in which water is in short supply is to carry out work designed to transfer resource The said transfer would affect the NorteDuero and Ebro river and in the latter instance would involve the transfer of hm The documentation used by MWL and contained in the aforementioned publication wa produced by the then socialist government However since another party ha been in power in Spain Bearing this in mind doe the Commission agree with the statement made by MWL in the publication on the need to transfer water from the Ebro catchment area If so doe it believe that the Cohesion Fund would serve a a suitable financial instrument for that purpose ha the current Spanish Government made the Commission aware of it view on the statement and proposal contained in the MWL report on the feasibility of transfer from the River Ebro to other catchment area and on possible financing arrangement,Manuel Escolá Hernando

1419,Shipbuilding is a strategic industry in many Member States. The Council recognised in the Conclusions to the May 2001 Council that the shipbuilding sector needed to continue to increase  In order to increase the current technological leadership in specific sectors of the market the industry needs to position itself to improve and lead innovation in Europe so as to turn the European Unions shipbuilders and suppliers of marine equipment into world leaders in the sector by 2015 as set down in the  to the Council the European Parliament the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions LeaderSHIP 2015 COM20030717. Several European nations as in the case of Galicia are heavily focused on the sea  shipbuilding fishing and shellfish sea transport  and have an exemplary record with regard to innovation adapting to fresh challenges in  to innovation  in shipbuilding and ship repair even while undergoing an extremely intense process of industrial conversion. However since 2004 the Izar-Fene shipyard now the  Navantia has been under a ban on civilian ship building on the basis of an agreement between the Commission and the Spanish Government in 2004 on returning state aids which ban civilian shipbuilding until 2015. The Spanish Congress and the Galician Parliament have demanded that the ban on civilian shipbuilding in this Galician shipyard be lifted on the grounds that this restriction makes no sense and even less so at a time of crisis in the financial economic and energy sectors because the shipyard has a workforce of great potential which is not being used in a region where the shipbuilding industry has been of key importance to regional development and innovation and where it moreover possesses the added value of the abilities and skilled knowledge of the sectors workforce who during the last years in which they were active scored major successes with offshore oil-industry construction work.

544,Air quality has  a focus of increasing attention in European legislation. The concentration of pollutants in the air is regulated by Directives 92/72/EEC 96/62/EC 99/30/EC sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide particulate matter and lead 2000/69/EC carbon monoxide and benzene and 2002/3/EC ozone. The Auto-Oil Directive was transposed in Portugal in 2000 Decree Law No 104/2000 Decree Law No 281/2000. The directives laying down air quality limit values were transposed into Portuguese legislation in 2002 and 2003 Decree Law No 111/2002 Decree Law No 320/2003. However the older Portuguese legislation continued to be applied until 2005 or 2010. As far as most pollutants are concerned European air quality directives are generally more restrictive than national laws. If there is a delay in enforcing the European directives people are exposed to excessively high concentrations of pollutants and hence to needless and unjustified risks. Scientific studies even suggest that the limit values underlying national legislation give no protection against the health effects of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter unlike the limit values laid down in the new European directives. 1. What measures will the Commission take to speed up the enforcement of European air quality legislation within the European area so as to protect the public more effectively 2. The European air quality directives have existed for more than a decade.

1200,On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organisation WHO declared a pandemic caused by the spread of the H1N1  known as swine flu. One year on from this declaration of a state of alert conclusions have been drawn by two documents an investigation published by the British Medical Journal which shook public opinion by calling into question the transparency of the findings of the WHO task force on the dangerousness of the virus in question and a report by Mr Paul Flynn MP on the WHOs behaviour in managing the new H1N1 influenza. Mr Flynn declared before the Social Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe that the vaccination programme set up by the WHO was nothing but placebo medicine on a large scale. The only certainty appears to be that thanks to the race by governments all over the world to stockpile vaccines the  have earned at least USD 7 billion according to estimates by the bank J.P.

2295,My attention has been drawn  made by several municipalities in Latvia that the Cabinet of Ministers in Latvia is not respecting the principles of good governance laid down in the European Regional Development Fund Regulation. An alliance of several municipalities in Latvia is contesting the discriminatory manner in which projects have been selected for the allocation of funds from the budget showing contempt for consultation with regional and local authorities and blatantly allocating project funds to three preferred cities on the basis of political favour and not in accordance with the merits of individual project proposals from other regions of the country.

3319,The agreement for the implementation of measures for the preservation of the grey eagle and protection of its habitat signed by the Aerocas  with the Land and Housing Ministry of the Valencian regional government Comunidad Valenciana enters into serious contradiction with the decisions made in 2001 under the environmental impact statement for the CastellÊ_/CastellÊ_n airport with regard to the conservation of this protected species. The new agreement permits activities on the premises of the planned airport which would be totally  with those listed and authorised by the environmental impact statement the entire feeding area far from being preserved would be eliminated and conservation would apply only to nests identified inside the planned airport and in its immediate environs and for the duration of the rearing period.

1801,After the European Union on 4 May 1998 had issued the Finnish Government an official warning concerning the taxation of used cars imported into Finland from other Member States on 27 November 1998 the Finnish Government submitted to the national parliament a bill seeking to alter albeit in very minor respects the taxation of the vehicles in question. In my view even after this change Finnish tax legislation as it relates to imported used cars will still be in breach of Article 95 of the Treaty on European Union the repercussions being so severe that in practice this tax will create inequality between used cars imported from any other Member State and those purchased in Finland. The new bill has hardly changed the situation as I described it in my written question to the Commission dated 11 December 1997. The key provision of the Finnish law on the taxation of cars can be found in Article 7 to which the Commissions also drew attention. This article has been changed in such a way that the tax abatement for used cars imported into Finland would be as a general rule 06  per month of use as against 05  under the terms of the law currently in force. It is quite clear that such a minor change in no way solves the fundamental problem which is that imported vehicles which are several years old which are the most sought-after will remain out of reach for Finnish consumers. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that our closest neighbour in the European Union Sweden abolished this form of tax on cars in 1996. As a result the import of used vehicles has  a realistic option for private individuals in Sweden. I should like to point out to the Commission once again that the proper functioning of the internal market is hampered by the fact that the Finnish tax legislation on cars as amended  and incorporates many technical details which allow the customs authorities far too much leeway to take decisions based on an interpretation of the law. What measures does the Commission plan to take in connection with the new Finnish legislation on the taxation of used cars in order to ensure that it is brought into line with Article 95 of the Treaty,E-3910/98,0,After European Union May issued Finnish Government official warning concerning taxation used car imported Finland Member States November Finnish Government submitted national parliament bill seeking alter albeit minor respect taxation vehicle question In view even change Finnish tax legislation relates imported used car still breach Article Treaty European Union repercussion severe practice tax create inequality used car imported Member State purchased Finland The new bill hardly changed situation I described written question Commission dated December The key provision Finnish law taxation car found Article Commissions also drew attention This article changed way tax abatement used car imported Finland would general rule per month use term law currently force It quite clear minor change way solves fundamental problem imported vehicle several year old soughtafter remain reach Finnish consumer The situation exacerbated fact closest neighbour European Union Sweden abolished form tax car As result import used vehicle realistic option private individual Sweden I like point Commission proper functioning internal market hampered fact Finnish tax legislation car amended incorporates many technical detail allow custom authority far much leeway take decision based interpretation law What measure Commission plan take connection new Finnish legislation taxation used car order ensure brought line Article Treaty,PPE,Finland,After the European Union on May had issued the Finnish Government an official warning concerning the taxation of used car imported into Finland from other Member States on November the Finnish Government submitted to the national parliament a bill seeking to alter albeit in very minor respect the taxation of the vehicle in question In my view even after this change Finnish tax legislation a it relates to imported used car will still be in breach of Article of the Treaty on European Union the repercussion being so severe that in practice this tax will create inequality between used car imported from any other Member State and those purchased in Finland The new bill ha hardly changed the situation a I described it in my written question to the Commission dated December The key provision of the Finnish law on the taxation of car can be found in Article to which the Commissions also drew attention This article ha been changed in such a way that the tax abatement for used car imported into Finland would be a a general rule per month of use a against under the term of the law currently in force It is quite clear that such a minor change in no way solves the fundamental problem which is that imported vehicle which are several year old which are the most soughtafter will remain out of reach for Finnish consumer The situation is exacerbated by the fact that our closest neighbour in the European Union Sweden abolished this form of tax on car in As a result the import of used vehicle ha a realistic option for private individual in Sweden I should like to point out to the Commission once again that the proper functioning of the internal market is hampered by the fact that the Finnish tax legislation on car a amended and incorporates many technical detail which allow the custom authority far too much leeway to take decision based on an interpretation of the law What measure doe the Commission plan to take in connection with the new Finnish legislation on the taxation of used car in order to ensure that it is brought into line with Article of the Treaty,Raimo Ilaskivi

3450,Handing over a sheep or a goat to pay your childrens school fees such barter trade may seem a little old-fashioned but in Zimbabwe it has again  the payment method approved by the government. The Zimbabweans call this the goat economy. The countrys economy has been in a sorry state for a long time. In 2009 Zimbabwe made the US dollar legal tender because its own Zimbabwe dollar had declined in value to the point where it was worth less than toilet paper according to an article in NOS.1 The main reason for the shortage of funds is Mugabe. For example last year the Government of Zimbabwe announced that foreign businesses were required to surrender their shares to Zimbabweans. 1.

14,A KOMO certificate is required for the export of finger-joint wooden window sills to the Netherlands. The provisions of the certificate depart to some extent from the Austrian German and Swiss provisions. Verification of these provisions for KOMO certification in particular involves considerable financial outlay. Four inspections a year are mandatory in the Netherlands whereas all other European countries require no more than two inspections in respect of quality provisions. Although the Holzforschung Austria 3 facility has been able to carry out this verification for some time the main inspection is still carried out by an institute in the Netherlands in an extremely bureaucratic fashion. In this instance it is the detailed aspects which are most problematic. There are European standards for the classification and testing of adhesives those standards are also applied by the Netherlands. Testing and certification of an adhesive or similar product by a renowned European research institute is not recognised for KOMO certification purposes however. The same test must be repeated by an institute in the Netherlands. To resolve these problems an attempt is being made in cooperation with the research and inspection institutes in Germany Switzerland the Netherlands and Austria to standardise the existing provisions for window sills and bring them into line with European standards but the Netherlands withdrew after the initial discussions and are no longer collaborating. Certification of timber products constitutes a further problem. Only in the Netherlands is certification required for a host of public works projects that the timber  from sustainably managed forests. In Austria too the Forests Act stipulates ongoing verification of sustainable forest management. A European certification system PEFC involving all European states apart from the Netherlands is currently being developed. The question is then whether such bureaucratic measures are erecting obstacles to trade which actually ought not to exist in the EU. The fact is that in all essential respects the requirements to be met in the Netherlands by a technical product must be the same as in Central Europe.

331,In dealings with the authorities aliens often claim the existence of a family relationship which offers advantages when applying for asylum and subsequently also during asylum procedures. These family relationships can only rarely be proven beyond doubt by official documents. A DNA test  like a paternity test  would provide that clear proof.

2064,In its answer to my question for written answer E-000098/2016 on the coal tar detected in asphalt waste imported from the Netherlands to Galicia in 2009 the Commission states that Member States have an obligation to apply Directive 2008/98/EC effectively  so as to ensure that areas contaminated with asphalt waste are depolluted without recycling. The legal proceedings conducted in Spain concluded with the importer being found guilty and ordered to remove some 135 000 tonnes of waste from a hillside in the municipality of Cabanas. The Galician Environmental Planning Agency APLU on the other hand has approved the use of such waste for urban planning purposes deeming it to be dry waste and overlooking the fact that the Ferrol Estuary has been classified a sensitive area. Furthermore no attempt has been made to remove the waste despite the court order. The investigating magistrates have confirmed that 800 000 tonnes of asphalt waste used in public and private works were imported through the port of Ferrol and that no one has given notification  with the directive and depolluting of the contaminated areas. 1.

2887,As of September the European Commission is intending to reduce the amount of tarry substances emitted during the traditional smoking of meats. To this end it is planning to prohibit the production of smoked meats. This decision will have a negative impact on Polish businesses trading in meat. Small and medium-sized enterprises will particularly suffer in this respect and thousands or people working in smoking plants will lose their jobs. However the worst aspect of this is that the new law was adopted without advance warning to businesses which were informed after the fact that their livelihood would be unlawful from September. In respect of the above I wish to ask 1. Why did the Commission allow the prohibition to be introduced without informing businesses in advance 2. Has the Commission taken into account that this decision will destroy regional culture because a centuries-old traditional means of smoking meat will  unlawful from September 3.

324,This June the European Court of Auditors adopted a special report entitled A European high-speed rail network not a reality but an ineffective patchwork. I find its conclusions extremely concerning not least the observation that the sustainability of EU co-funding is at risk for want of a coherent EU-wide strategy on the development of high-speed rail. Although the EU has invested and continues to invest a lot in its development and modernisation the market is failing to deliver efficient cross-border connections. The sector is at a pivotal moment with ongoing legislative work on the next MFF the TEN-T procedures and rail passengers rights and   passenger services soon to be implemented. In view of the above 1. What initiatives will the Commission take to address the risk of EU funding  unsustainable 2. Does the Commission share the view that EU investment in a high-speed rail network is only worthwhile if it is conceived at EU level and beyond the rationale of each Member State and that it may now be time to establish a rail strategy for Europe 3.

937,The finance ministers of the 10 Member States that are outside the eurozone are holding discussions on  position on the latest developments regarding the eurozone. The ministers met recently at a business dinner and similar meetings are likely to be held more often in the future although they should remain on an informal basis. The main reason for these meetings is the fact that the non-eurozone countries do not wish to be second-class Member States. Relations between eurozone and non-eurozone Member States are currently strained. Given the current situation does the Commission think that the creation of two blocs  a eurozone bloc and a non-eurozone bloc  within the EU would be a dangerous development,E-010958/2011,0,The finance minister Member States outside eurozone holding discussion position latest development regarding eurozone The minister met recently business dinner similar meeting likely held often future although remain informal basis The main reason meeting fact noneurozone country wish secondclass Member States Relations eurozone noneurozone Member States currently strained Given current situation Commission think creation two bloc eurozone bloc noneurozone bloc within EU would dangerous development,S&D,Slovakia,The finance minister of the Member States that are outside the eurozone are holding discussion on position on the latest development regarding the eurozone The minister met recently at a business dinner and similar meeting are likely to be held more often in the future although they should remain on an informal basis The main reason for these meeting is the fact that the noneurozone country do not wish to be secondclass Member States Relations between eurozone and noneurozone Member States are currently strained Given the current situation doe the Commission think that the creation of two bloc a eurozone bloc and a noneurozone bloc within the EU would be a dangerous development,Monika Flašíková Beňová

746,Since the fall of the Soviet Union between 1991 and 1999 the European Union has given EUR 1274 million in TACIS aid to Russia. One of the target areas for European aid going to Russia is to provide support for institutional legal and administrative reform and the EU is sponsoring reform programmes which aim at supporting a reform of the judicial system which is one of the many  in Russia. In addition to the EUR 20 million earmarked to train judges in the 20022003 period the Commission is investing EUR 32 million between 2004 and 2006 to support judicial reforms in Russia with the objective of achieving progress toward a well-functioning independent impartial accountable  and effective judiciary in Russia. This is based on the argument that well functioning domestic judicial institutions are a precondition for the effective application and enforcement of legislation. They are prerequisite for the establishment of a favourable climate for European and Russian business and investment. They are essential for the consolidation of democracy the rule of law and civil society. I believe that the Commission is correct in stating that a free and fair judicial system is of paramount importance for positive developments in society. However we have all recently witnessed the  of the Russian judicial system and illustrated by the Yukos case. This case shows that justice in Russia is nowadays a tool for political ends. European taxpayers have the right to expect improvement after hundreds of millions of their euros have been transferred to an increasingly authoritarian regime. The same could be said about the money that during the 20022003 period was earmarked for deregulation and de-monopolisation EUR 42 million and the total of EUR 50 million to strengthen civil society between 2002 and 2006. Is the Commission satisfied with the way that European taxpayers money has been used in attempts to reform the Russian legal system Is the Commission considering imposing conditions and clearer objectives for judicial reform aid to the Russian Federation as it is in the interest of the European Union that our neighbour not only pretends to know what the rule of law means but actually respects it.,E-2621/05,0,Since fall Soviet Union European Union given EUR million TACIS aid Russia One target area European aid going Russia provide support institutional legal administrative reform EU sponsoring reform programme aim supporting reform judicial system one many Russia In addition EUR million earmarked train judge period Commission investing EUR million support judicial reform Russia objective achieving progress toward wellfunctioning independent impartial accountable effective judiciary Russia This based argument well functioning domestic judicial institution precondition effective application enforcement legislation They prerequisite establishment favourable climate European Russian business investment They essential consolidation democracy rule law civil society I believe Commission correct stating free fair judicial system paramount importance positive development society However recently witnessed Russian judicial system illustrated Yukos case This case show justice Russia nowadays tool political end European taxpayer right expect improvement hundred million euro transferred increasingly authoritarian regime The could said money period earmarked deregulation demonopolisation EUR million total EUR million strengthen civil society Is Commission satisfied way European taxpayer money used attempt reform Russian legal system Is Commission considering imposing condition clearer objective judicial reform aid Russian Federation interest European Union neighbour pretend know rule law mean actually respect,PPE-DE,Sweden,Since the fall of the Soviet Union between and the European Union ha given EUR million in TACIS aid to Russia One of the target area for European aid going to Russia is to provide support for institutional legal and administrative reform and the EU is sponsoring reform programme which aim at supporting a reform of the judicial system which is one of the many in Russia In addition to the EUR million earmarked to train judge in the period the Commission is investing EUR million between and to support judicial reform in Russia with the objective of achieving progress toward a wellfunctioning independent impartial accountable and effective judiciary in Russia This is based on the argument that well functioning domestic judicial institution are a precondition for the effective application and enforcement of legislation They are prerequisite for the establishment of a favourable climate for European and Russian business and investment They are essential for the consolidation of democracy the rule of law and civil society I believe that the Commission is correct in stating that a free and fair judicial system is of paramount importance for positive development in society However we have all recently witnessed the of the Russian judicial system and illustrated by the Yukos case This case show that justice in Russia is nowadays a tool for political end European taxpayer have the right to expect improvement after hundred of million of their euro have been transferred to an increasingly authoritarian regime The same could be said about the money that during the period wa earmarked for deregulation and demonopolisation EUR million and the total of EUR million to strengthen civil society between and Is the Commission satisfied with the way that European taxpayer money ha been used in attempt to reform the Russian legal system Is the Commission considering imposing condition and clearer objective for judicial reform aid to the Russian Federation a it is in the interest of the European Union that our neighbour not only pretend to know what the rule of law mean but actually respect it,Christofer Fjellner
63,The vacation period is getting under way for millions of Europeans. Many people will be going away on holiday and many will take out extra insurance such as travel insurance. Studies have shown that in the case of the majority of risks the risk is already covered by existing insurance policies such as health insurance car insurance or legal expenses insurance. Consumers are therefore often paying more than once to be insured against the same risks without being informed of this or being doubly covered in the event of a claim. This is also leading in the event of a claim to uncertainty on the part of the consumer as to which insurance policy ultimately covers the risk concerned. A decision has been taken in the Netherlands in consultation with the Verbond voor Verzekeraars Insurers Association to look at whether it is possible to put an end to this detrimental situation for consumers by linking together policies and setting up a central information point to facilitate checks on whether insurance is being duplicated. This has led to an initial agreement being reached between  and the consumers association. 1. Is the Commission aware of the problem of duplicate insurance which is detrimental to the interests of consumers travelling on holiday elsewhere in Europe 2.

3397,France and Germany during the talks about a mandatory relocation mechanism suggested that this redistribution mechanism should function as follows  Arriving migrants in frontline Member States would be taken to waiting centres set up close to the arrival points. In these centres with the support of the European Asylum Support Office EASO arriving migrants would be quickly registered identified in accordance with EU regulations and assigned to the appropriate procedure.  A proportion of those asylum-seekers who are in clear need of protection would be reallocated to other Member States in accordance with the agreed distribution key. Other irregular migrants would be quickly returned. Frontex support for return operations should be expanded particularly when Member States experience an extraordinary influx of illegal third-country nationals.  Migrants who fall between the two categories namely those who are neither clearly in need nor clearly not in need of protection would have their situation examined in accordance with regular asylum procedures in frontline Member States.

157,From 2 to 5 May 2012 the third national congress of the Federation of Italian Immunology Allergology and Clinical Immunology Societies IFIACI was held in Verona where the results of a study conducted on 100 patients affected by coeliac disease were presented. The study detailed the effects on the test subjects of a recently discovered molecule called Zonulin.

61,A US-proposed TiSA annex on state-owned enterprises SOEs suggests that an SOE must operate like a private business using  considerations when it buys and sells services or when it buys goods if it is a services SOE. The SOE does not have to apply  considerations where it has a public mandate to deliver a service but it still cannot give preferences to local services and suppliers. This proposal if incorporated into the final TiSA would be a major constraint to the local operation of regional SOE branches and suggests a mandate to centralise procurement.

3218,On 29 April 2005 following the European Courts ruling against Italy for failure to implement Directive 2000/76/EC1 Judgment of the European Court of Justice Fourth Section of 2 December 2004 Case C97/04 the Italian Government approved a Legislative Decree implementing Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste. Article 214 of the Decree authorises co-incineration plants not subject to environmental impact assessments to use the simplified procedure referred to in the Ronchi Decree. This procedure is contrary to Community law. Article 217 requires the environmental impact assessment to be submitted only in the case of existing incineration plants operating on the basis of the Ronchi Decree simplified procedure and not for co-incineration plants including power stations and cement kilns. This is also contrary to Community law. Articles 49 and 513 stipulate that in the event of  authority failing to carry out inspections verification of the  with the authorisation issued is to be delegated to the plants manager through a qualified entity. Given the slowness of Italian provincial administrations and regional environmental protection agencies inspections are in fact delegated to the inspected plants themselves. Article 161 states that in authorisations  authority must lay down the maximum period of time during which any concentrations of polluting substances resulting from malfunctions or breakdowns may exceed the authorised emission limit values. In practice this represents a licence to pollute beyond the legal limits.

2312,A feasibility study on expanding the railway infrastructure between Rho and Gallarate Milan and Varese provinces by building a third railway track has been carried out. On 7 August 2009 the town councils of Rho Vanzago Pregnana Pogliano Nerviano and Parabiago received a copy of the final design which differs from the feasibility study in that it shows the construction of a fourth line. The feasibility study envisaged building a third railway line on an already existing track bed. However the final design shows two new lines neither of which utilise the existing trackbed and which would require  purchase and demolition of some private housing in the aforementioned towns. Because of its length type and location the final design for this railway infrastructure is subject to an environmental impact assessment under Italian law pursuant to Annex II to Directive 85/337/EEC1 as amended by Directive 97/11/EC2. This section of the line links Milan and Domodossola and expanding it to four lines at the RhoParabiago section and three lines between Parabiago and Gallarate will affect densely populated urban areas with over 200 000 inhabitants.

1665,The so-called euro pact has been decidedly rejected by civil society and has had practically no effect as far as calming the markets is concerned. The EP and the Commission are now working on an economic reform package that will constitute a Community legal framework for Member States policies concerning deficit and financial imbalances. Since the crisis began the Councils actions have focused on calming the markets and transmitting the message that there will be no repetition of the public deficit problem while there has been no attempt to implement policies for the real economy which might create wealth and jobs. Parliament has repeatedly called for the introduction of eurobonds but the Council continues to reject such an instrument. Economic policy while visibly following a neo-liberal line appears to be taking no account whatever of the need for medium- and long-term planning. France Italy and now Spain are in process of amending their constitutions to introduce a deficit limitation requirement using accelerated procedures which do not respect the need for a participatory democratic process.

3287,The French Government announced on 30 October 2012 its proposed merger between SCNF and RFF which manages the national rail network. Tony Berkeley a member of the British House of Lords and Director of the European Rail Freight Association took advantage of the opportunity of making his presence felt and stressing that the French proposal is in breach of EU legislation on the creation of an integrated  market for the transportation of passengers and goods. However SNCF and Deutsche Bahn the German  feel that  should not be forced to separate rail infrastructure from rail operation which is understandable and defensible. In October these  published a report questioning the effectiveness of separate operations. They argue that countries where rail systems are integrated such as Canada Japan and the United States have experienced a steady growth in investment and transportation of passengers and goods while the European market has stagnated. The results show that the integrated management of infrastructure and railway operations do not interfere with the efficiency and performance of railways. 1.

1583,For many years now the waste-water treatment plant in Sarria has been overloaded and as long ago as 2010 Augas de Galicia the Galician water authority found that the plant needed upgrading in order to be fully operational. It frequently overflows into the Sarria river causing alarming levels of contamination. Indeed the president of the MiÊ±o-Sil Water Authority recently acknowledged that spillages from the plant exceed maximum contamination values running the risk of EU fines. This problem stems from an increase in the local population for which the plant does not have sufficient capacity together with leaks in the pipelines. 1.

2429,According to official sources on 24 August Turkey launched its biggest military campaign to date in Syria sending tanks planes and special forces across the border to take back one of ISs strongholds in Syria at the same time as attacking the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units YPG. Just one day into the offensive at least 49 civilians had been killed in Turkish airstrikes on Kurdish-majority areas in the east and west of Jarabulus.

2458,Each year in Europe around 100 billion plastic bags are consumed and it is estimated that 1 000 billion bags are sold worldwide each year at the bottom of the class in Europe is Italy with its 20 billion bags a year. Even if only some of the bags used worldwide are dispersed into the environment a report by Legambiente stresses the limited use of these plastic bags which are used for only a few minutes but which pollute and harm the environment for years they are cheap to produce and on occasion to import from Asian countries while the cost of collecting recycling and disposing of them is substantial. It is estimated that by replacing the 300 plastic bags that each Italian consumes per year with only 10 reusable bags 180000 tonnes of oil and the same amount of CO2 emissions would be saved. Many countries have already made great strides in the fight against plastic plastic bags were banned in South Africa in 2003 in Eritrea Somalia and Rwanda in 2005 and in Kenya and Tanzania in 2007 while in the United States the city of San Francisco was the first ever to ban the use of plastic bags in supermarkets and pharmacies. A European directive has imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags from 1 January 2011 to be replaced by more environmentally friendly reusable shopping bags. In Italy 150 municipalities have already banned plastic while nearly all the major retailers have made the necessary adjustments and many manufacturers have switched their production. Should the Commission not launch an awareness campaign to promote a cultural shift among consumers that will give fresh impetus to the use of environmentally friendly bags and that will lead to the disappearance of needless plastic,E-7590/2010,0,Each year Europe around billion plastic bag consumed estimated billion bag sold worldwide year bottom class Europe Italy billion bag year Even bag used worldwide dispersed environment report Legambiente stress limited use plastic bag used minute pollute harm environment year cheap produce occasion import Asian country cost collecting recycling disposing substantial It estimated replacing plastic bag Italian consumes per year reusable bag tonne oil amount CO emission would saved Many country already made great stride fight plastic plastic bag banned South Africa Eritrea Somalia Rwanda Kenya Tanzania United States city San Francisco first ever ban use plastic bag supermarket pharmacy A European directive imposed ban use plastic bag January replaced environmentally friendly reusable shopping bag In Italy municipality already banned plastic nearly major retailer made necessary adjustment many manufacturer switched production Should Commission launch awareness campaign promote cultural shift among consumer give fresh impetus use environmentally friendly bag lead disappearance needle plastic,PPE,Italy,Each year in Europe around billion plastic bag are consumed and it is estimated that billion bag are sold worldwide each year at the bottom of the class in Europe is Italy with it billion bag a year Even if only some of the bag used worldwide are dispersed into the environment a report by Legambiente stress the limited use of these plastic bag which are used for only a few minute but which pollute and harm the environment for year they are cheap to produce and on occasion to import from Asian country while the cost of collecting recycling and disposing of them is substantial It is estimated that by replacing the plastic bag that each Italian consumes per year with only reusable bag tonne of oil and the same amount of CO emission would be saved Many country have already made great stride in the fight against plastic plastic bag were banned in South Africa in in Eritrea Somalia and Rwanda in and in Kenya and Tanzania in while in the United States the city of San Francisco wa the first ever to ban the use of plastic bag in supermarket and pharmacy A European directive ha imposed a ban on the use of plastic bag from January to be replaced by more environmentally friendly reusable shopping bag In Italy municipality have already banned plastic while nearly all the major retailer have made the necessary adjustment and many manufacturer have switched their production Should the Commission not launch an awareness campaign to promote a cultural shift among consumer that will give fresh impetus to the use of environmentally friendly bag and that will lead to the disappearance of needle plastic,Aldo Patriciello

1791,New draconian eligibility criteria especially concerning the bank guarantee are a feature of the relaunch of the decentralised cooperation programmes announced by the European Commission.

678,In recent weeks the Spanish Government has adopted special economic intervention measures in relation to a major financial group BFA. Given view the alarm that this has created the Government has decided to contract four auditing firms to assess the state of Spains financial system. Since its establishment the European Banking Authority has been carrying out various stress tests on financial institutions in fulfilment of its duties under Regulation EU No 1093/2010 of 24 November. These tests unfortunately have been contradicted by events as the state of the Irish banks was found to be satisfactory in the first test. The financial institution Dexia was also marked as outstanding in another stress test and has since been rescued by the Belgian Government. Moreover in the case of Spanish financial institutions Bankia a subsidiary of the aforementioned BFA was said to have relatively small capital requirements of less than EUR 200 million which is far removed from the EUR 23 billion which the new managers now find they need. Given all the above and in view of Article 3 of the aforementioned Regulation which states the responsibility of the EBA to the European Parliament I would like to ask 1.

149,Significant steps have been taken to improve road safety and cut the number of people killed on the roads in the EU which has fallen by 36  during the last 10 years. However many Member States have failed to meet the target for the decade of reducing deaths by half. One of these is the UK which has seen a 48  fall.

1539,Since the mid-1990s the government of Botswana has been trying to move the indigenous Bushmen people away from the area that they as well as most scientific studies consider to be their ancestral land in which their historic and cultural origins are to be found the Central Kalahari Game Reserve currently a national park. In 1997 the government forced out half of the Bushmen population and in 2005 only 250 ethnic Bushmen were living in the reserve. In 2006 Botswanas High Court ruled in favour of the Bushmen granting them the right to return to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. However the government of Botswana has continued to block the Bushmens return to the area on the one hand imposing regulations providing for a maximum stay of one month within the national park with anyone overstaying this period facing arrest and on the other hand prohibiting the Bushmen from carrying out their traditional subsistence activities such as hunting. All this is in breach of the decision of the Botswana High Court. Is the Commission aware of these facts The Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme agreed between the government of Botswana and the Commission on 9 December 2007 provides for an aid budget of over EUR 80 million. The document makes explicit reference to safeguarding human rights and to the need for Botswana to uphold and preserve the cultural identity of the Bushmen.

1651,Soil fumigants are pesticides which used in large quantities in Europe. Monocultures and vulnerable crop varieties are made possible by the use of these chemicals. Metam sodium is one of these soil fumigants and was not approved by the EU in 2009. However after pressure from a range of Member States its use was allowed to be continued on the basis of a so-called essential use provision. The 15 Member States making use of this derogation were obliged to report on the essential use and start action plans to develop alternatives. In the meantime industry applied for full legalisation of metam sodium based on another derogation resubmission. The EFSA submitted its peer review1 and the Commission will soon be required  up with a proposal for the Standing Committee.

2232,According to the most recent data only 19.4 of incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs were allocated to women. Meanwhile special loans for women are no longer being offered. The situation is similar in the other Member States. Despite the fact that they are better educated than men women venture into entrepreneurship less often than men and they are usually motivated by necessity rather than by a perceived opportunity. At EU level the proportion of entrepreneurs who are female is 33 but in the newly launched ventures it is only 30. The reasons that women most often put forward to explain the fall in female entrepreneurship include the impossibility of reconciling work life and family life the lack of mentoring and the difficulty of obtaining funding owing to lack of property ownership. The Barcelona objective set by the European Council had only been achieved by 10 Member States by 2011. Employment among women with children is 20 lower than among women without children in most Member States.

3495,The current proposals for a IPPC Directive and the proposal for a Council Directive on the ecological quality of water represent two extremes with regard to deepening and broadening the new EU policy on water. Firstly the proposed IPPC Directive develops conditional authorization into an environmental emission licence  planning permission operating permits and emission authorization. The proposal is based on the notion of the holistic nature of the environment and attempts as regards the emission aspect to  the current fragmentation of environmental protection measures concerning air water and waste. Secondly the ecological water quality Directive takes further the clean-up requirements and programme-based approach in a host of water Directives. The ecological water quality Directive requires all sources of pollution which impair the water ecology to be registered  In particular as part of an integrated programme the requirements deriving from the many different water Directives are to be set out and the necessary measures to implement them and measures to achieve ecological quality indicated. This is then once more an holistic approach but one which takes as its starting point the water quality aspect i.e. immission. 1. How can the Commission expect this new approach to produce significant progress in terms of European water pollution control in view of the fact that in many Member States the transposition of the few ambitious water pollution control provisions is still causing considerable problems 2.

1334,The Commission has recently made it clear that it regards the fact that the Irish-registered carrier Norwegian Air has still not received a licence for flights between the EU and the USA and is therefore unable to offer more flights on this route as a clear breach of the EU-US Air Transport Agreement. I have already Question E-002583/2014 drawn the Commissions attention to the fact that Norwegian Airs business model is based on social dumping. For example  is establishing a structure that forces pilots to be based in Thailand thus avoiding paying tax and social insurance contributions in Europe where these pilots actually spend most of their time.

218,Under an Italian Supreme Court ruling businesses in the Italian province of Alessandria which were damaged by flooding in 1994 were entitled to a 90 rebate on the tax they had paid for 1995 1996 and 1997. All the businesses were entitled to this aid but only some had received a rebate by the time the payments were suspended as a result of Commission investigation SA33083 which found that the rebates were  with EU rules on state aid. The Commission did not however require the rebates to be repaid. As a result some businesses have received a rebate which they are not required to pay back while others in the same situation have not.

1578,On 4 July 2013 the Commission was ordered by the European Court of Justice ECJ to reverse its refusal to authorise Orphacol an orphan drug used to treat a rare fatal liver condition. This marks the end of a bureaucratic nightmare for CTRS a small French laboratory that markets Orphacol in France and which the Commission has victimised for four years on the basis of flimsy legal arguments that the ECJ has  refuted. This campaign was probably carried out at the behest of an American laboratory Asklepion Pharmaceuticals that wished to take over the market. This is a first up until now the Commission which has no scientific expertise of its own has always blindly followed the opinion of the European Medicines Agency in London. The ECJ seized by CTRS with the support of France the UK Austria Denmark and the Czech Republic has shown that legally the Commission did not have a leg to stand on. 1. Does the Commission intend to appeal 2. What lessons will the Commission draw from the many mistakes it made in this case 3. Why did the Commission demand clinical tests to  data when this is unethical in the case of a rare disease since a clinical trial would expose patients to the risk of serious liver damage or even death 4. Why did the Commission claim that evidence of well-established medicinal use of at least 10 years had to be established from 1997 when Orphacol was registered as a trademark and not 1993 since it was then a mere pharmaceutical preparation used in hospitals 5. Does the Commission acknowledge that the above argument does not hold water because it concerns the same active substance used without a marketing authorisation and under a different name 6. The fact that there is no other drug on the market that can treat the potentially rapidly fatal liver conditions in question is not in doubt.

Is the Commission aware that the Klagenfurt route initially proposed for this cross-border link ran along the Netherlands side of the border to the E34 border crossing point and that the environmental impact assessment concluded that this route was the best solution however for some time it was anticipated that the route would be ruled out if the Commission listed the heathland area along the border under the Habitats Directive Does the Commission realise that the objections to the Klagenfurt route have since been withdrawn as the area is not to be given European protection partly because a German military airfield was sited in the Netherlands heathland from 1940 to 1945 3. Is the Commission aware that when the Klagenfurt route was not expected to be feasible a number of variants were developed for an A74 Plateau route crossing the border further south and then linking up with the A73 bridge over the Meuse between Venlo and Tegelen.

781,In some respects the internal market does not function at all or functions poorly where the operating resources and inputs needed in agriculture are concerned.

A study based on this research indicates a potential saving for health insurance funds consumers and farmers in Austria of about EUR 1 billion a year.

2535,On 21 May 2001 Professor Saad Eddin Ibrahim was sentenced to seven years in prison by an Egyptian State Security Court which ruled that his efforts to ensure the parliamentary elections were monitored were defamatory to the State. Professor Ibrahim had been arrested the previous July when the Ibn Khaldoun Study Centre of which he was the director began holding courses on voter education and training for monitors of last Autumns parliamentary elections.

1788,Medicinal products are a  of EU public healthcare.  in a variety of forms with either a chemical or a biological molecular make-up. Over recent decades and in particular in 2001 the EU has built up an extensive set of laws to govern the manufacture categorisation labelling distribution and advertising of and the authorisation to market medicinal products for human use. In 2003 for example a new authorisation procedure was introduced to cover biosimilar medicinal products which are biological drugs specifically developed to closely resemble existing reference drugs. The pharmaceuticals sector is highly innovative and recent years have seen the development of a new category of medicinal products known as  drugs which are used in the treatment of chronic illnesses in particular. Scientific literature defines  drugs as medicinal products with a broad  synthetic non-biological structure which it is impossible to isolate or fully describe using current physicochemical analysis techniques. It is difficult therefore to pinpoint the elements in these drugs make-up that give them their therapeutic effect a fact that significantly hampers the work of the bodies responsible for assessing the safety and efficacy of copies of original drugs. To gauge the expected efficacy of copies and safeguard patient welfare even more effectively some experts have suggested introducing a special regulatory procedure focusing on this new category of  drugs. Is the Commission aware of this debate in the  What is its view on the matter Does the Commission intend to take steps to regulate  drugs in the near future,E-003540-14,0,Medicinal product EU public healthcare variety form either chemical biological molecular makeup Over recent decade particular EU built extensive set law govern manufacture categorisation labelling distribution advertising authorisation market medicinal product human use In example new authorisation procedure introduced cover biosimilar medicinal product biological drug specifically developed closely resemble existing reference drug The pharmaceutical sector highly innovative recent year seen development new category medicinal product known drug used treatment chronic illness particular Scientific literature defines drug medicinal product broad synthetic nonbiological structure impossible isolate fully describe using current physicochemical analysis technique It difficult therefore pinpoint element drug makeup give therapeutic effect fact significantly hamper work body responsible assessing safety efficacy copy original drug To gauge expected efficacy copy safeguard patient welfare even effectively expert suggested introducing special regulatory procedure focusing new category drug Is Commission aware debate What view matter Does Commission intend take step regulate drug near future,ALDE,Belgium,Medicinal product are a of EU public healthcare in a variety of form with either a chemical or a biological molecular makeup Over recent decade and in particular in the EU ha built up an extensive set of law to govern the manufacture categorisation labelling distribution and advertising of and the authorisation to market medicinal product for human use In for example a new authorisation procedure wa introduced to cover biosimilar medicinal product which are biological drug specifically developed to closely resemble existing reference drug The pharmaceutical sector is highly innovative and recent year have seen the development of a new category of medicinal product known a drug which are used in the treatment of chronic illness in particular Scientific literature defines drug a medicinal product with a broad synthetic nonbiological structure which it is impossible to isolate or fully describe using current physicochemical analysis technique It is difficult therefore to pinpoint the element in these drug makeup that give them their therapeutic effect a fact that significantly hamper the work of the body responsible for assessing the safety and efficacy of copy of original drug To gauge the expected efficacy of copy and safeguard patient welfare even more effectively some expert have suggested introducing a special regulatory procedure focusing on this new category of drug Is the Commission aware of this debate in the What is it view on the matter Does the Commission intend to take step to regulate drug in the near future,Frédérique Ries

2102,The European authorities are to investigate Facebooks automatic photograph identification feature which is being made available in various countries following its launch in the United States a few months ago. When new photographs are uploaded Facebook carries out automatic facial recognition of people appearing in them and suggests possible identities. The user then chooses whether to confirm or reject its suggestions. The question raised is whether in the eyes of the European regulator this is a violation of privacy since no prior consent is sought from those tagged in photos. Facebook allows users to turn off the feature to prevent their network of friends automatically tagging photos in which they appear but in order to do so they have to alter their default privacy settings.

840,The term infibulation is used to refer to a procedure involving mutilation in which the vagina is partially sealed by sewing the labia majora together leaving only a small hole for the passage of urine and menstrual blood removal of the clitoris may or may not also be included. Other types of female genital mutilation also exist in various cultural areas the less radical sunna circumcision involving cutting of only part of the clitoris and excision which entails  clitoridectomy.

3439,After the closure of the Malagrotta waste disposal site the waste emergency in Rome and the Lazio region continues to arouse concern. As yet no sites suitable for the disposal of waste from Rome and the numerous local authorities in Rome Province have been identified which constitutes a situation of grave criticality in terms of urban waste management. Lack of an adequate strategy and continuing recourse to emergency policies led Special Waste Emergency Commissioner Sottile to issue an extraordinary emergency permit for waste to be deposited at the Cupinoro disposal site until 31 December 2013 despite the fact that the site was already at saturation point and unable to  further waste.

2843,The Romanian Government has suspended international adoption procedures for one year as of 21 June this year on the basis of Decision No 55. However according to Article 2 of the decision the suspension will not affect legal adoption proceedings concerning applications for which the Romanian Adoption Committee assigned children before 14 December 2000. Nevertheless the government Decision does not make any reference to the international adoption applications which were approved by that date but for which the placement of a minor is still pending. For this reason in Spain alone 1200 adoption proceedings have been suspended thereby preventing 1200 Romanian children from escaping the poverty in which they are living and from  part of a stable and prosperous family environment as is the case for applications made by 100 families in Galicia.

449,Finanzen.nl reports that the Dutch Fund and Asset Management Association DUFAS has calculated that the abolition of dividend tax in the Netherlands will adversely affect private investors in Dutch investment funds1. Abolition will cost Dutch private investors more than EUR 130 million a year. This is because on the one hand it will no longer be possible to offset tax deducted at source abroad and on the other hand access to lower rates of foreign taxation at source via tax conventions will be hampered. Thus the abolition of dividend tax represents a threat to the EU pension plan for Dutch pension savers as the EU pension plan relies mainly on strengthening the third pension pillar the individual savings system. What the individual savings system entails is that pension savers invest in investment funds which by means of their broad spread of investment targets minimise their investment risks and in the long term can achieve a reasonable return on investment. It is precisely this use of investment funds that will be made unattractive by the abolition of dividend tax. 1. Does the Commission believe that this abolition of dividend tax will adversely affect the sustainability of the EU pension plan 2. Does the Commission consider it desirable for millions of Dutch pension savers to be placed at a disadvantage  with pension savers in other EU Member States 3. How will the Commission draw the Netherlands Governments attention to the undesirability of abolishing dividend tax 1finanzen.nl/obligaties/nieuws/Particulieren-betalen-ruim-130-miljoen-euro-per-jaar-voor-afschaffing-dividendbelasting-1027492591,E-004428-18,0,Finanzennl report Dutch Fund Asset Management Association DUFAS calculated abolition dividend tax Netherlands adversely affect private investor Dutch investment fund Abolition cost Dutch private investor EUR million year This one hand longer possible offset tax deducted source abroad hand access lower rate foreign taxation source via tax convention hampered Thus abolition dividend tax represents threat EU pension plan Dutch pension saver EU pension plan relies mainly strengthening third pension pillar individual saving system What individual saving system entail pension saver invest investment fund mean broad spread investment target minimise investment risk long term achieve reasonable return investment It precisely use investment fund made unattractive abolition dividend tax Does Commission believe abolition dividend tax adversely affect sustainability EU pension plan Does Commission consider desirable million Dutch pension saver placed disadvantage pension saver EU Member States How Commission draw Netherlands Governments attention undesirability abolishing dividend tax finanzennlobligatiesnieuwsParticulierenbetalenruimmiljoeneuroperjaarvoorafschaffingdividendbelasting,ENF,Netherlands,Finanzennl report that the Dutch Fund and Asset Management Association DUFAS ha calculated that the abolition of dividend tax in the Netherlands will adversely affect private investor in Dutch investment fund Abolition will cost Dutch private investor more than EUR million a year This is because on the one hand it will no longer be possible to offset tax deducted at source abroad and on the other hand access to lower rate of foreign taxation at source via tax convention will be hampered Thus the abolition of dividend tax represents a threat to the EU pension plan for Dutch pension saver a the EU pension plan relies mainly on strengthening the third pension pillar the individual saving system What the individual saving system entail is that pension saver invest in investment fund which by mean of their broad spread of investment target minimise their investment risk and in the long term can achieve a reasonable return on investment It is precisely this use of investment fund that will be made unattractive by the abolition of dividend tax Does the Commission believe that this abolition of dividend tax will adversely affect the sustainability of the EU pension plan Does the Commission consider it desirable for million of Dutch pension saver to be placed at a disadvantage with pension saver in other EU Member States How will the Commission draw the Netherlands Governments attention to the undesirability of abolishing dividend tax finanzennlobligatiesnieuwsParticulierenbetalenruimmiljoeneuroperjaarvoorafschaffingdividendbelasting,Auke Zijlstra

1175,To tackle the emergency resulting from landings of migrants on the EUs Mediterranean southern border the European agency responsible for external border security Frontex has made the necessary preparations for targeted action by extending its Hermes operation. It__ knowledge that the landings have occurred mainly on the island of Lampedusa but Frontex has scattered its officers 20 people across southern Italy sending them in some cases to places whose present importance is negligible from the border control point of view. The modest resources employed a few million euros to cope with the emergency and the ill-judged deployment of personnel add up to a deplorable paradox. The most striking fact about the Frontex budget for 2011 EUR 88 million in all apparent even on cursory reading is that only EUR 39 million or 44__ of the total is earmarked for operations and the remainder is accounted for by personnel costs administrative overheads and expenditure on analyses research and training. Given the strategic errors in the case concerned here it seems even more absurd to spend so much on personnel and sundry analyses when the former are turning out to be useless and the latter have proved to be inaccurate. Does the Commission consider this to be the wrong way to allocate resources Does it not also believe that there has to be a general rethink in economic and operational terms in order to make Frontex as a whole genuinely effective,E-003458/2011,1,To tackle emergency resulting landing migrant EUs Mediterranean southern border European agency responsible external border security Frontex made necessary preparation targeted action extending Hermes operation It knowledge landing occurred mainly island Lampedusa Frontex scattered officer people across southern Italy sending case place whose present importance negligible border control point view The modest resource employed million euro cope emergency illjudged deployment personnel add deplorable paradox The striking fact Frontex budget EUR million apparent even cursory reading EUR million total earmarked operation remainder accounted personnel cost administrative overhead expenditure analysis research training Given strategic error case concerned seems even absurd spend much personnel sundry analysis former turning useless latter proved inaccurate Does Commission consider wrong way allocate resource Does also believe general rethink economic operational term order make Frontex whole genuinely effective,EFD,Italy,To tackle the emergency resulting from landing of migrant on the EUs Mediterranean southern border the European agency responsible for external border security Frontex ha made the necessary preparation for targeted action by extending it Hermes operation It knowledge that the landing have occurred mainly on the island of Lampedusa but Frontex ha scattered it officer people across southern Italy sending them in some case to place whose present importance is negligible from the border control point of view The modest resource employed a few million euro to cope with the emergency and the illjudged deployment of personnel add up to a deplorable paradox The most striking fact about the Frontex budget for EUR million in all apparent even on cursory reading is that only EUR million or of the total is earmarked for operation and the remainder is accounted for by personnel cost administrative overhead and expenditure on analysis research and training Given the strategic error in the case concerned here it seems even more absurd to spend so much on personnel and sundry analysis when the former are turning out to be useless and the latter have proved to be inaccurate Does the Commission consider this to be the wrong way to allocate resource Does it not also believe that there ha to be a general rethink in economic and operational term in order to make Frontex a a whole genuinely effective,Claudio Morganti

1061,The social security system covering political refugees who left the countries of Eastern Europe to return to Greece was previously governed by Law 1539/85 which recognised only a small part of the period worked by these persons in the countries concerned. Greece had concluded bilateral agreements with Eastern European countries which had taken in political refugees mainly during the 1980s and had undertaken to recognise the period during which contributions were paid by the  refugees by means of a lump sum payment in accordance with Greek social security legislation. Now that the countries of Eastern Europe have joined the European Union the Greek refugees returning from these countries enjoy immediate and full recognition of their social security rights under Community law Regulation EEC No 1408/71. Nevertheless it appears that some of these countries feel that they have fulfilled their obligations to the Greek refugees pointing to the bilateral agreements on the matter. Given that many of these political refugees who are by now quite elderly are living on a very modest pension or are obliged to continue working in order to meet the contribution requirements will the Commission say a whether any of the new Member States - and if so which - believe that they have fulfilled their obligations to  Greek political refugees under Regulation EEC No 1408/71 b what measures have been taken to deal with similar cases concerning Bulgaria and Romania c what measures it plans to take to ensure that the rights of Greek political refugees are fully and immediately recognised,E-1862/04,0,The social security system covering political refugee left country Eastern Europe return Greece previously governed Law recognised small part period worked person country concerned Greece concluded bilateral agreement Eastern European country taken political refugee mainly undertaken recognise period contribution paid refugee mean lump sum payment accordance Greek social security legislation Now country Eastern Europe joined European Union Greek refugee returning country enjoy immediate full recognition social security right Community law Regulation EEC No Nevertheless appears country feel fulfilled obligation Greek refugee pointing bilateral agreement matter Given many political refugee quite elderly living modest pension obliged continue working order meet contribution requirement Commission say whether new Member States believe fulfilled obligation Greek political refugee Regulation EEC No b measure taken deal similar case concerning Bulgaria Romania c measure plan take ensure right Greek political refugee fully immediately recognised,GUE/NGL,Greece,The social security system covering political refugee who left the country of Eastern Europe to return to Greece wa previously governed by Law which recognised only a small part of the period worked by these person in the country concerned Greece had concluded bilateral agreement with Eastern European country which had taken in political refugee mainly during the s and had undertaken to recognise the period during which contribution were paid by the refugee by mean of a lump sum payment in accordance with Greek social security legislation Now that the country of Eastern Europe have joined the European Union the Greek refugee returning from these country enjoy immediate and full recognition of their social security right under Community law Regulation EEC No Nevertheless it appears that some of these country feel that they have fulfilled their obligation to the Greek refugee pointing to the bilateral agreement on the matter Given that many of these political refugee who are by now quite elderly are living on a very modest pension or are obliged to continue working in order to meet the contribution requirement will the Commission say a whether any of the new Member States and if so which believe that they have fulfilled their obligation to Greek political refugee under Regulation EEC No b what measure have been taken to deal with similar case concerning Bulgaria and Romania c what measure it plan to take to ensure that the right of Greek political refugee are fully and immediately recognised,Dimitrios Papadimoulis

One major instrument proposed is to fine countries which breach budget rules over an extended period either by running an excessive government deficit or because of excessive government debt.

1992,The Monterosso arable and forest holding located in San Lorenzo in Campo in the Province of Pesaro has been involved for more than 100 years in the protection and development of the area not least through projects to cultivate older and more genetically pure varieties of emmer wheat. In particular it grows Triticum Dicoccum emmer wheat which because of its intrinsic qualities is the only one to be used in the production of pasta in Italy. Furthermore it is the only Italian seed to be certified and patented because it is a genetically pure strain which can be traced back to that of ancient Mediterranean civilisations. Finally thanks to  of geographical and climatic conditions that have made this area unique of its kind the resulting product is high in fibre and in antioxidants and polyphenolics.

1803, CST srl Centro Servizi Terziario Tertiary Services Centre Via Tagliamento 45 I-00198 Rome has been promoting the Edunet project which falls under the ADAPT2 Community programme and is co-financed by the European Social Fund. On 22 and 23 September 2000 a meeting of the General Council of the Italian trade union Fisascat-C was held at the Hotel Le Meridien Promenade des Anglais 1 Nice. The agenda for the meeting shows that on 22 September some kind of round table on the Edunet Project had been scheduled for the two hours preceding the council meeting proper. CST had provided the participants in the Fisascat-Cisl General Council meeting with a contract to sign stating their involvement in the Edunet training programme together with a form addressed to CST for the reimbursement of the expenses incurred for this international conference on the Edunet Project. Clearly the time devoted to the conference on the Edunet Project assuming it actually took place was minimal and insufficient to warrant the reimbursement of the expenses of those participating in the Fisascat-Cisl General Council meeting at the expense of the funds earmarked for the Edunet Project.

602,Terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians are occurring with tragic regularity. Only the method changes sometimes a suicide bomber on a bus in a pizzeria or a discotheque snipers shooting at random or breaking into a kibbutz and killing a mother in front of her two children. It is a war of attrition which spreads terror using a variety of atrocities. Every now and then a politician or non-aligned intellectual or occasionally a newspaper denounces this barbarity recognising that it is an expression of opposition to the resumption of dialogue and a savage fight against the only democracy in that part of the world. Europe on the other hand remains silent and seems to be demonstrating its inability to play a proper role in trying to establish equilibrium for the future of the Middle East. This inability obviously means that other powers will help to determine that future. Does the Commission not consider that true equilibrium is to be found in condemning these atrocities and recognising that they are inappropriate for the achievement of peace Since the EU funds the Palestinian Authority does it not consider it appropriate to exert strong political pressure on the Authority itself to make it publicly condemn terrorist action and urge it to take steps to put a stop to the appalling cycle of terrorist acts Does the Commission not consider that it is precisely in Europes interests to make its position as an agent of equilibrium credible in order to bring about peace and safeguard Israel as a democracy in the Middle East,E-3675/02,0,Terrorist attack Israeli civilian occurring tragic regularity Only method change sometimes suicide bomber bus pizzeria discotheque sniper shooting random breaking kibbutz killing mother front two child It war attrition spread terror using variety atrocity Every politician nonaligned intellectual occasionally newspaper denounces barbarity recognising expression opposition resumption dialogue savage fight democracy part world Europe hand remains silent seems demonstrating inability play proper role trying establish equilibrium future Middle East This inability obviously mean power help determine future Does Commission consider true equilibrium found condemning atrocity recognising inappropriate achievement peace Since EU fund Palestinian Authority consider appropriate exert strong political pressure Authority make publicly condemn terrorist action urge take step put stop appalling cycle terrorist act Does Commission consider precisely Europes interest make position agent equilibrium credible order bring peace safeguard Israel democracy Middle East,UEN,Italy,Terrorist attack against Israeli civilian are occurring with tragic regularity Only the method change sometimes a suicide bomber on a bus in a pizzeria or a discotheque sniper shooting at random or breaking into a kibbutz and killing a mother in front of her two child It is a war of attrition which spread terror using a variety of atrocity Every now and then a politician or nonaligned intellectual or occasionally a newspaper denounces this barbarity recognising that it is an expression of opposition to the resumption of dialogue and a savage fight against the only democracy in that part of the world Europe on the other hand remains silent and seems to be demonstrating it inability to play a proper role in trying to establish equilibrium for the future of the Middle East This inability obviously mean that other power will help to determine that future Does the Commission not consider that true equilibrium is to be found in condemning these atrocity and recognising that they are inappropriate for the achievement of peace Since the EU fund the Palestinian Authority doe it not consider it appropriate to exert strong political pressure on the Authority itself to make it publicly condemn terrorist action and urge it to take step to put a stop to the appalling cycle of terrorist act Does the Commission not consider that it is precisely in Europes interest to make it position a an agent of equilibrium credible in order to bring about peace and safeguard Israel a a democracy in the Middle East,Cristiana Muscardini

According to reports by human rights organisations they are subjected to torture. Often it is impossible or very difficult for the vast majority of Palestinian prisoners to exercise their right to receive visits from family members.

2374,Recent studies have suggested that there could be undersea reserves of up to eight billion barrels of crude oil worth about USD 400 billion off Cyprus. The Cypriot Government has signed a production sharing agreement with Houston-based Noble Energy to launch exploration activities in a 324 000-hectare economic zone southeast of the island which borders Israeli waters. Noble Energy is to begin exploring Cypruss offshore Mediterranean Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ by 1 October. Not far from Cypruss EEZ Noble Energy also has rights to drill in Israels offshore natural gas field Leviathan along with  Delek. Cooperation between Cyprus Greece and Israel could lead to the creation of a major energy hub in the Eastern Mediterranean. Exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean remains a contentious issue. Nevertheless Greece and Cyprus are members of the EU and the explorations in the Eastern Mediterranean may prove significant to Europes energy security and diversity. These untapped reserves outside of Europe have the potential not only to help stabilise the Greek economy but also to contribute significantly to Europes energy independence as well.

3186,On 16 October 2017 Israel approved a request for creation of a new settlement of 31 housing units in the Palestinian city of Hebron. As a result tens of thousands of Palestinians were driven from their homes to make room for a few dozen illegal settlers. The Israeli settlement policy simply serves to consolidate its territorial gains while undermining efforts to achieve a peaceful two-state solution and peace.

They discussed the situation with regard to the nuclear negotiations human rights and recent developments in the region. The EU is neither conducting a human rights dialogue with Iran nor does it have a Delegation in Tehran. A European Parliament resolution of 2014 called for the opening of an EU delegation in Iran.

296,The directive on services in the internal market which is__ known as the Bolkestein Directive has two priority goals namely to remove barriers to freedom of establishment in other Member States and to remove all barriers to freedom of movement for services within the Union. The first objective may represent a full-blown threat to the Member States ability to regulate a service on their own territory without it moreover being possible for such regulation to be carried out at European level. The second objective through what has__ known as the country of origin principle would enable undertakings to be subject solely to the legislation of the country in which they are established irrespective of where they are providing the service. These two objectives are a major threat to the future of public services in Europe. Firstly because reducing restrictions on establishment will be__ with state regulation of specific public services of general interest such as health or education services. Secondly because the country of origin rule would enable an undertaking to provide a service in a Member State without the environmental or labour legislation of that Member State applying to it since it would be subject to the legislation of the Member State in which the undertaking was established. This directive is therefore a clear attack on public services. Rather than providing for harmonisation based on the consolidation of specific public services at European level the directive seeks to restrict those that currently exist at national level. In view of this fact the Spanish trade unions the European Trade Union Confederation ETUC and various associations and social movements__ out against the directive and organised a European campaign under the slogan Stop Bolkestein including a demonstration in Brussels on 19 March against the proposal for a directive.

7,Is  with European Union principles for  within the context of a Europeanfunded project  workplace design neither to be discussed with European institutions responsible for health and safety at work nor with employees representatives The European Bus System of the Future project1 which receives funding of over EUR 26 million under the seventh research framework programme has been under way since September 2008 and is due to end in September 2012. Some 47 partners with more than 200 people are participating in this project which is led by the UITP represented by Umberto Guida. In the course of a number of discussions between the European Transport Workers Federation ETF and the UITP the ETF has made it clear that the new drivers workplace design must be discussed with organisations representing employees. Within the context of the EBSF project the drivers workplace work package is due to undergo driving simulator tests in May 2011. A further request to be provided with information and to participate was turned down by the lead manufacturer EVOBus on 15 April 2011 on grounds of confidentiality. Given the size of the project involving 47 partners and more than 200 people it is not clear why of all people the employee side is not being allowed to participate in the drivers workplace work package on grounds of confidentiality. Ergonomic findings clearly demonstrate that drivers workplace design has a significant influence on protecting the health of driving staff. Clear reductions in the back and disc conditions typically suffered by driving staff have been achieved thanks to the drivers workplace developed by German trade unions and associations. Particularly in the light of demographic change ergonomics will continue to play a major role in future and drivers workplaces must be designed in a way which  with the ageing process. When the industry is receiving funding of some EUR 26 million it must also respect the principles of the European social model and the requirement to consult the social partners. The same also applies with regard to the involvement of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. 1EBSF www.ebsf.eu,P-005336/2011,0,Is European Union principle within context Europeanfunded project workplace design neither discussed European institution responsible health safety work employee representative The European Bus System Future project receives funding EUR million seventh research framework programme way since September due end September Some partner people participating project led UITP represented Umberto Guida In course number discussion European Transport Workers Federation ETF UITP ETF made clear new driver workplace design must discussed organisation representing employee Within context EBSF project driver workplace work package due undergo driving simulator test May A request provided information participate turned lead manufacturer EVOBus April ground confidentiality Given size project involving partner people clear people employee side allowed participate driver workplace work package ground confidentiality Ergonomic finding clearly demonstrate driver workplace design significant influence protecting health driving staff Clear reduction back disc condition typically suffered driving staff achieved thanks driver workplace developed German trade union association Particularly light demographic change ergonomics continue play major role future driver workplace must designed way ageing process When industry receiving funding EUR million must also respect principle European social model requirement consult social partner The also applies regard involvement European Agency Safety Health Work EBSF wwwebsfeu,S&D,Germany,Is with European Union principle for within the context of a Europeanfunded project workplace design neither to be discussed with European institution responsible for health and safety at work nor with employee representative The European Bus System of the Future project which receives funding of over EUR million under the seventh research framework programme ha been under way since September and is due to end in September Some partner with more than people are participating in this project which is led by the UITP represented by Umberto Guida In the course of a number of discussion between the European Transport Workers Federation ETF and the UITP the ETF ha made it clear that the new driver workplace design must be discussed with organisation representing employee Within the context of the EBSF project the driver workplace work package is due to undergo driving simulator test in May A further request to be provided with information and to participate wa turned down by the lead manufacturer EVOBus on April on ground of confidentiality Given the size of the project involving partner and more than people it is not clear why of all people the employee side is not being allowed to participate in the driver workplace work package on ground of confidentiality Ergonomic finding clearly demonstrate that driver workplace design ha a significant influence on protecting the health of driving staff Clear reduction in the back and disc condition typically suffered by driving staff have been achieved thanks to the driver workplace developed by German trade union and association Particularly in the light of demographic change ergonomics will continue to play a major role in future and driver workplace must be designed in a way which with the ageing process When the industry is receiving funding of some EUR million it must also respect the principle of the European social model and the requirement to consult the social partner The same also applies with regard to the involvement of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work EBSF wwwebsfeu,Ismail Ertug
3335,The Vocational Training Centre KEK Kronos Ltd has taken over the coordination and management of the Greek language teaching programme for the unemployed immigrants and refugees to be carried out in Athens and has concluded a contract with hourly-paid private teachers. The KEK is required to pay the teachers salaries within two months at the latest of the end of the educational part of each programme provided it has been paid the second tranche of the funding.

2750,According to figures from the Portuguese National Statistical Institute for the first quarter of 2011 the value of the dairy products imported into Portugal amounted to EUR 97 million of which EUR 30 million was accounted for by milk equivalent to 41 million litres EUR 34 million by cheese and EUR 33 million by yogurt. In the last milk year between 1 April 2010 and March 2011 Portuguese national production fell by 2  that is to say 36 million litres. All this has been happening in a country which until recently was self-sufficient in dairy products and is now having to contend with high external debt  brought about largely by a long-standing substantial agri-foodstuffs deficit. At present Portuguese dairy farms are fighting for their survival faced as they are with ruinous milk prices not high enough to offset production costs. This situation is due entirely to the liberalisation of the milk sector and to the production quotas which have been raised in anticipation of their total abolition. In the light of these worrying facts 1. Does the Commission not believe that given the weight of the evidence in other words the figures now available and the emergency that they reflect it is imperative to keep milk production quotas in place and adjust them according to the needs of the individual Member States and the size of their production capacities 2.

912,A young Iraqi man Ali Bashar who arrived in Germany in October 2015 at the height of the refugee crisis is alleged to have raped and murdered a 14-year-old girl Susanna Feldman in Wiesbaden on 22 May 2018. Bashar claimed that he and the girl had been friends but that they had had an argument and he had killed her when she threatened to call the police1. Bashars asylum application had been rejected in December 2016 and he left Germany with his family to return to Iraq on 2 June 2018 before he was named as a suspect in the Feldman case. Thus despite being in Germany illegally and  a murder he was able to cross the border in both directions undetected and untroubled by the police.

31,The above is the title of an article published by the daily La Stampa Turin Italy on 13 September 2011 following a meeting held in Rome bringing together 150 delegates from the OCSE member countries and organised by Italys representative responsible for action against racism xenophobia and discrimination. During this meeting reference was made to figures from the French Government revealing that every two days in France there is an attack on a Catholic church or a cemetery with acts of desecration destruction and vandalism. The French foreign ministrys representative for religious affairs Roland Dubertrand who was present at the meeting did not deny these acts of vandalism stressing that 70  of their authors have been handed over to justice. This means that the matter is being taken seriously. Introducing the proceedings the Vaticans foreign minister Dominique Mamberti claimed that Christians are the worlds most persecuted religious group declaring Unfortunately there are signs in our countries too of attempts to marginalise religion and discriminate against Christians. It is no-ones intention to equate such attempts with the killings that occur in other regions of the world. However when a climate of discrimination against Christians is created the seeds of crime may be sown. The minister further argued that the root of the problem is a failure to conceive the true nature of religious freedom. It is not just one freedom among others it is the basis of all freedoms and is not merely a matter of freedom of worship. Religious freedom includes the right to preach educate run schools convert and participate in public life and is not synonymous with relativism or with the notion that all religions are of equal value. 1. Is the Commission aware of the situation in France as described at the above meeting 2. What does the Commission believe to be the factors cultural juridical or other which have contributed to these disturbing developments at the heart of Europe 3. Does the Commission believe that such developments mean that religious freedom as described by the Vatican minister is increasingly under threat in Europe 4. Does the Commission not consider that the need to fight racism xenophobia and discrimination requires that initiatives be taken to put an end to these irrational acts of violence against Christians and their places of worship 5. Will the Commission also take a position on the acts of violence perpetrated against Christians in other parts of the world,E-008662/2011,0,The title article published daily La Stampa Turin Italy September following meeting held Rome bringing together delegate OCSE member country organised Italys representative responsible action racism xenophobia discrimination During meeting reference made figure French Government revealing every two day France attack Catholic church cemetery act desecration destruction vandalism The French foreign ministry representative religious affair Roland Dubertrand present meeting deny act vandalism stressing author handed justice This mean matter taken seriously Introducing proceeding Vaticans foreign minister Dominique Mamberti claimed Christians world persecuted religious group declaring Unfortunately sign country attempt marginalise religion discriminate Christians It noones intention equate attempt killing occur region world However climate discrimination Christians created seed crime may sown The minister argued root problem failure conceive true nature religious freedom It one freedom among others basis freedom merely matter freedom worship Religious freedom includes right preach educate run school convert participate public life synonymous relativism notion religion equal value Is Commission aware situation France described meeting What Commission believe factor cultural juridical contributed disturbing development heart Europe Does Commission believe development mean religious freedom described Vatican minister increasingly threat Europe Does Commission consider need fight racism xenophobia discrimination requires initiative taken put end irrational act violence Christians place worship Will Commission also take position act violence perpetrated Christians part world,PPE,Italy,The above is the title of an article published by the daily La Stampa Turin Italy on September following a meeting held in Rome bringing together delegate from the OCSE member country and organised by Italys representative responsible for action against racism xenophobia and discrimination During this meeting reference wa made to figure from the French Government revealing that every two day in France there is an attack on a Catholic church or a cemetery with act of desecration destruction and vandalism The French foreign ministry representative for religious affair Roland Dubertrand who wa present at the meeting did not deny these act of vandalism stressing that of their author have been handed over to justice This mean that the matter is being taken seriously Introducing the proceeding the Vaticans foreign minister Dominique Mamberti claimed that Christians are the world most persecuted religious group declaring Unfortunately there are sign in our country too of attempt to marginalise religion and discriminate against Christians It is noones intention to equate such attempt with the killing that occur in other region of the world However when a climate of discrimination against Christians is created the seed of crime may be sown The minister further argued that the root of the problem is a failure to conceive the true nature of religious freedom It is not just one freedom among others it is the basis of all freedom and is not merely a matter of freedom of worship Religious freedom includes the right to preach educate run school convert and participate in public life and is not synonymous with relativism or with the notion that all religion are of equal value Is the Commission aware of the situation in France a described at the above meeting What doe the Commission believe to be the factor cultural juridical or other which have contributed to these disturbing development at the heart of Europe Does the Commission believe that such development mean that religious freedom a described by the Vatican minister is increasingly under threat in Europe Does the Commission not consider that the need to fight racism xenophobia and discrimination requires that initiative be taken to put an end to these irrational act of violence against Christians and their place of worship Will the Commission also take a position on the act of violence perpetrated against Christians in other part of the world,Cristiana Muscardini

3115,The Basilicata Agency for Environmental Protection ARPAB while reiterating that it has not found any sign of oil contamination in the Pertusillo reservoir admits that sediment traces have been discovered in random samples indicating that the quantities are lower than in previous samples analysed and pointing out that no statutory limits in fact exist. The findings show that the threat to the lake resides in not only hydrocarbons but also pesticides heavy metals aluminium boron iron vanadium and zinc parasiticides plant protection products and  chlorinated solvents. While most of the individual pollutants are below legal limits the resulting bioaccumulation is detrimental to water quality.

610,Accidents in Community waters particularly those involving the ERIKA and the Prestige and the massive damage suffered by the environment and workers in different sectors and industries have led the Community Institutions to pay particular attention to the problems of safety at sea. Improving conditions of access to Community ports and all operations and services connected therewith should form part of these objectives and therefore be an integral part of the chain of measures to be adopted with a view to increasing safety and preventing future accidents. It is well known that many vessels flying flags of convenience and even some of those flying the flag of a Member State sail with crews which are not merely rather small but frequently lack appropriate specific professional training. Everything indicates that the directive on access to the market in port services currently under discussion will allow services of a technical nautical nature and those involving the loading and unloading of cargo to be carried out by the crews of the vessels using the ports who will not be obliged to seek authorisation and therefore subject to verification of  to operate under conditions of maximum safety both of the workers themselves and the installations in which they will be working.

3249,With reference to Question E0788/07 of 10 April 2007 on the possibility of retroactive application of Directive 2003/18/EC1 to cover events at the Ansaldo-Breda plant in Pistoia the Commission has stated that the national provisions transposing the directive were not in force at the time of those events and are therefore not applicable unless they are deemed to apply retroactively under national law. As things currently stand Directive 2003/18/EC was transposed into Italian law by means of Legislative Decree No 257/06 but has not yet been fully implemented in individual regions. Article 4 of Legislative Decree No 257/06 delegates responsibility for full implementation of the directive to individual regions by means of regional laws provided that there is no need as there may well be in this case for the Italian Ministry for Health to publish an explanatory note on the legislative decree. This note will ensure uniform implementation in the various regions as well as providing legal certainty and guarding against legal challenges.  of some aspects such as health-related issues has given rise to a large number of doubts as to exactly which body is responsible for supervision and which undertakings are to be covered by decontamination measures. This has meant that individual regions including Tuscany have not yet been able to lay down specific provisions concerning the matter. Given the above can the Commission say what steps the Tuscany Regional Council may take with a view to enabling the provisions of Directive 2003/18/EC to apply retroactively,E-3124/07,0,With reference Question E April possibility retroactive application Directive EC cover event AnsaldoBreda plant Pistoia Commission stated national provision transposing directive force time event therefore applicable unless deemed apply retroactively national law As thing currently stand Directive EC transposed Italian law mean Legislative Decree No yet fully implemented individual region Article Legislative Decree No delegate responsibility full implementation directive individual region mean regional law provided need may well case Italian Ministry Health publish explanatory note legislative decree This note ensure uniform implementation various region well providing legal certainty guarding legal challenge aspect healthrelated issue given rise large number doubt exactly body responsible supervision undertaking covered decontamination measure This meant individual region including Tuscany yet able lay specific provision concerning matter Given Commission say step Tuscany Regional Council may take view enabling provision Directive EC apply retroactively,UEN,Italy,With reference to Question E of April on the possibility of retroactive application of Directive EC to cover event at the AnsaldoBreda plant in Pistoia the Commission ha stated that the national provision transposing the directive were not in force at the time of those event and are therefore not applicable unless they are deemed to apply retroactively under national law As thing currently stand Directive EC wa transposed into Italian law by mean of Legislative Decree No but ha not yet been fully implemented in individual region Article of Legislative Decree No delegate responsibility for full implementation of the directive to individual region by mean of regional law provided that there is no need a there may well be in this case for the Italian Ministry for Health to publish an explanatory note on the legislative decree This note will ensure uniform implementation in the various region a well a providing legal certainty and guarding against legal challenge of some aspect such a healthrelated issue ha given rise to a large number of doubt a to exactly which body is responsible for supervision and which undertaking are to be covered by decontamination measure This ha meant that individual region including Tuscany have not yet been able to lay down specific provision concerning the matter Given the above can the Commission say what step the Tuscany Regional Council may take with a view to enabling the provision of Directive EC to apply retroactively,Roberta Angelilli

1474,Mobile television provides an opportunity to develop new services that European citizens want to have. Commissioner Reding said as much in her speech at the Hanover CeBIT trade fair in March and she repeated it in Paris this week. Such services need dedicated infrastructure which means having frequencies available. For technical reasons some Member States will have difficulties in releasing sufficient resources in the normal frequencies for fixed television UHF to  and continuous territorial coverage. An alternative solution would be to use the resources available in another frequency band the S band 2 GHz. Industrialists cannot put time and money into the technological developments required to make use of this frequency band until the framework regulating the use of such bands is established and stabilised and this is the regulators responsibility. However since it involves systems whose very purpose is to support mobility including transnational mobility the framework that regulates them should be laid down at least in part at European level. The Commission has been working for some while on establishing this regulatory framework for using the S band 2 GHz. The issue is difficult affected as it is  technical and legal constraints. But it would be unfortunate if the pace of the Commissions work were out of phase with market expectations and thus disappointed the Europeans waiting for these new services. Could the Commission inform Parliament of the state of progress with its work in setting up the regulatory framework for the S band 2 GHz and in particular of the likelihood of adopting that framework by the end of 2006,E-2391/06,0,Mobile television provides opportunity develop new service European citizen want Commissioner Reding said much speech Hanover CeBIT trade fair March repeated Paris week Such service need dedicated infrastructure mean frequency available For technical reason Member States difficulty releasing sufficient resource normal frequency fixed television UHF continuous territorial coverage An alternative solution would use resource available another frequency band S band GHz Industrialists cannot put time money technological development required make use frequency band framework regulating use band established stabilised regulator responsibility However since involves system whose purpose support mobility including transnational mobility framework regulates laid least part European level The Commission working establishing regulatory framework using S band GHz The issue difficult affected technical legal constraint But would unfortunate pace Commissions work phase market expectation thus disappointed Europeans waiting new service Could Commission inform Parliament state progress work setting regulatory framework S band GHz particular likelihood adopting framework end,PSE,France,Mobile television provides an opportunity to develop new service that European citizen want to have Commissioner Reding said a much in her speech at the Hanover CeBIT trade fair in March and she repeated it in Paris this week Such service need dedicated infrastructure which mean having frequency available For technical reason some Member States will have difficulty in releasing sufficient resource in the normal frequency for fixed television UHF to and continuous territorial coverage An alternative solution would be to use the resource available in another frequency band the S band GHz Industrialists cannot put time and money into the technological development required to make use of this frequency band until the framework regulating the use of such band is established and stabilised and this is the regulator responsibility However since it involves system whose very purpose is to support mobility including transnational mobility the framework that regulates them should be laid down at least in part at European level The Commission ha been working for some while on establishing this regulatory framework for using the S band GHz The issue is difficult affected a it is technical and legal constraint But it would be unfortunate if the pace of the Commissions work were out of phase with market expectation and thus disappointed the Europeans waiting for these new service Could the Commission inform Parliament of the state of progress with it work in setting up the regulatory framework for the S band GHz and in particular of the likelihood of adopting that framework by the end of,Catherine Trautmann
1745,A number of researchers have drawn attention to the rapid global decline in large old trees the increase of threats to trees and a lack of adequate tree protection a report on this issue was published in the December issue of the Science magazine. Several EU countries are putting together catalogues containing information on these tree resources.

1397,Underground gasification of coal is a ground-breaking method of obtaining energy from coal directly in the coal seam by injecting a gasifying agent into the fired deposits and bringing the gas produced to the surface. Last year in Poland an underground coal gasification scheme was carried out successfully. In the Katowice Wieczorek coal mine within seven weeks from 30 June 2014 200 tonnes of coal were converted into process gas with no serious impediments. Underground coal gasification does not require costly infrastructure. Compared with a traditional coal mine this technology is more beneficial. Not only does it make full exploitation of layers of coal possible thereby preserving jobs in the mining sector but it could also substantially improve energy security and bring about environmental benefits because harmful substances produced in  process remain underground. Also due to use of this technology the remains of layers of coal which up to now were not accessible in the conventional manner can be put to use. The overall process is as efficient as the traditional burning of coal while at the same time it is cleaner and  The test conducted in Poland was successful but this technology is still a long way away  application and EU funding might be necessary for use to  widespread.

2876,On 31 January 2013 the Israeli army attacked positions within Syria in regard to which Written Question E-001124/2013 was tabled. The Vice-President/High Representatives answer to this was clearly  as she avoided saying how she would assess Russias position on these attacks. Since tabling that question violence in the region has escalated for which Israel is responsible with its sporadic bombing of Syrian positions. The Syrian crisis is one of the  major concerns with Bashar al-Assads army confronting militias belonging to AlQaeda. Israels involvement brought about another stage in destablisation as well as increasing Israels tense relations with Russia. But with the announcement by the EU Foreign Ministers that the arms embargo is to be lifted Russia has stepped forward and said that it will arm the Syrian regime. Intervention in Syria could further destabilise international relations at global level between the major powers. Russia is holding firm to its position in support of the government of Bashar alAssad claiming that this will prevent conflict as  notwithstanding the violence deployed by Bashar alAssads government within its own borders  foreign intervention in the form of arms sales will undoubtably destabilise the region even more taking the conflict and its violence beyond Syrias borders as happened in Libya. It seems likely that arming Syrian groups will also impact Turkey which since it shares a long border with Syria will further step up military presence in the area. How does the Commission assess Russias position in looking for a way out of the conflict that does not entail foreign military intervention What impact will lifting the arms embargo have on EU relations with Russia And on relations with Turkey How can the EU guarantee that the potential export of weapons to Syrian opposition groups will not lead to more arms being traded to the various armed groups in the region,E-006047-13,0,On January Israeli army attacked position within Syria regard Written Question E tabled The VicePresidentHigh Representatives answer clearly avoided saying would ass Russias position attack Since tabling question violence region escalated Israel responsible sporadic bombing Syrian position The Syrian crisis one major concern Bashar alAssads army confronting militia belonging AlQaeda Israels involvement brought another stage destablisation well increasing Israels tense relation Russia But announcement EU Foreign Ministers arm embargo lifted Russia stepped forward said arm Syrian regime Intervention Syria could destabilise international relation global level major power Russia holding firm position support government Bashar alAssad claiming prevent conflict notwithstanding violence deployed Bashar alAssads government within border foreign intervention form arm sale undoubtably destabilise region even taking conflict violence beyond Syrias border happened Libya It seems likely arming Syrian group also impact Turkey since share long border Syria step military presence area How Commission ass Russias position looking way conflict entail foreign military intervention What impact lifting arm embargo EU relation Russia And relation Turkey How EU guarantee potential export weapon Syrian opposition group lead arm traded various armed group region,GUE/NGL,Spain,On January the Israeli army attacked position within Syria in regard to which Written Question E wa tabled The VicePresidentHigh Representatives answer to this wa clearly a she avoided saying how she would ass Russias position on these attack Since tabling that question violence in the region ha escalated for which Israel is responsible with it sporadic bombing of Syrian position The Syrian crisis is one of the major concern with Bashar alAssads army confronting militia belonging to AlQaeda Israels involvement brought about another stage in destablisation a well a increasing Israels tense relation with Russia But with the announcement by the EU Foreign Ministers that the arm embargo is to be lifted Russia ha stepped forward and said that it will arm the Syrian regime Intervention in Syria could further destabilise international relation at global level between the major power Russia is holding firm to it position in support of the government of Bashar alAssad claiming that this will prevent conflict a notwithstanding the violence deployed by Bashar alAssads government within it own border foreign intervention in the form of arm sale will undoubtably destabilise the region even more taking the conflict and it violence beyond Syrias border a happened in Libya It seems likely that arming Syrian group will also impact Turkey which since it share a long border with Syria will further step up military presence in the area How doe the Commission ass Russias position in looking for a way out of the conflict that doe not entail foreign military intervention What impact will lifting the arm embargo have on EU relation with Russia And on relation with Turkey How can the EU guarantee that the potential export of weapon to Syrian opposition group will not lead to more arm being traded to the various armed group in the region,Willy Meyer
2702,The first beer dispensing system that does not use carbon dioxide has been developed. Instead of the heavy steel barrels that have a greater carbon footprint when being transported this system uses lighter barrels in recyclable PET. These barrels are placed inside an actual hyperbaric chamber in which each time the beer is tapped growing pressure is generated enabling the beer to flow out. There is therefore no need to use the pressure exerted by the emission of CO2 it also helps to avoid beer saturation and oxidation processes that might impair its quality. Given that the new dispensing system has obtained an Environmental Product Declaration EPD as it would reduce emissions by 31  can the Commission say whether it intends to encourage its use throughout the EU,E-006329/2011,0,The first beer dispensing system use carbon dioxide developed Instead heavy steel barrel greater carbon footprint transported system us lighter barrel recyclable PET These barrel placed inside actual hyperbaric chamber time beer tapped growing pressure generated enabling beer flow There therefore need use pressure exerted emission CO also help avoid beer saturation oxidation process might impair quality Given new dispensing system obtained Environmental Product Declaration EPD would reduce emission Commission say whether intends encourage use throughout EU,EFD,Italy,The first beer dispensing system that doe not use carbon dioxide ha been developed Instead of the heavy steel barrel that have a greater carbon footprint when being transported this system us lighter barrel in recyclable PET These barrel are placed inside an actual hyperbaric chamber in which each time the beer is tapped growing pressure is generated enabling the beer to flow out There is therefore no need to use the pressure exerted by the emission of CO it also help to avoid beer saturation and oxidation process that might impair it quality Given that the new dispensing system ha obtained an Environmental Product Declaration EPD a it would reduce emission by can the Commission say whether it intends to encourage it use throughout the EU,Oreste Rossi

2930,The Commissions proposal for a new EU regulation on flax fibres creates problems for Finland because it proposes that the production of flax for fibres should be made subject to a quota based on quantities cultivated in the past. In Finland the growing of flax for fibres has hitherto been a small-scale operation. The growing of flax for fibres is only in its infancy in Finland and this is why the amount cultivated in recent years has been small at only a few thousand hectares per year. At present Finnish agriculture is undergoing a structural change with farms being forced to diversify into new directions and find new profitable forms of crop. One promising alternative seems to be the production of fibre flax a plant which suits Finnish conditions very well. We have had per-hectare yields of the same order as in the best growing areas in the EU and the cultivation of flax for fibres is therefore expected to increase considerably in the future. The imposition of quotas is the worst thing that could happen to Finnish flax production at this juncture. At least three new flax processing plants are currently being built in Finland which will require in total by way of raw material the yield of at least 12 000 to 12 500 hectares of flax. If the Commissions new flax regulation is implemented in its current form it will deprive us of the opportunity to expand domestic cultivation and the new factories will thus have to operate with imported raw materials. These are not realistic conditions for developing the Finnish flax industry. Furthermore the requirement in the proposal that the product once made into fibre should contain not more than 5  of shives is too strict for the Finnish insulating wool production industry. The Commission proposal on subsidies also places Finland at a disadvantage in view of the low reference harvests it sets for fibre flax crops since the subsidies would be partly calculated on this basis. Different levels of aid are proposed for the processing of long and short fibres even though the definition of the differences between the different types of fibre is not clear and their use in practice is largely the same. What action will the Commission take to ensure that long- and short- fibre flax are not pointlessly separated from each other by these new definitions What does the Commission propose to do to ensure that there are good conditions for the cultivation and processing of fibre flax in Finland as elsewhere How does the Commission propose to protect the development of flax cultivation and processing and its prospects as a part of Finnish agriculture,E-2515/99,0,The Commissions proposal new EU regulation flax fibre creates problem Finland proposes production flax fibre made subject quota based quantity cultivated past In Finland growing flax fibre hitherto smallscale operation The growing flax fibre infancy Finland amount cultivated recent year small thousand hectare per year At present Finnish agriculture undergoing structural change farm forced diversify new direction find new profitable form crop One promising alternative seems production fibre flax plant suit Finnish condition well We perhectare yield order best growing area EU cultivation flax fibre therefore expected increase considerably future The imposition quota worst thing could happen Finnish flax production juncture At least three new flax processing plant currently built Finland require total way raw material yield least hectare flax If Commissions new flax regulation implemented current form deprive u opportunity expand domestic cultivation new factory thus operate imported raw material These realistic condition developing Finnish flax industry Furthermore requirement proposal product made fibre contain shives strict Finnish insulating wool production industry The Commission proposal subsidy also place Finland disadvantage view low reference harvest set fibre flax crop since subsidy would partly calculated basis Different level aid proposed processing long short fibre even though definition difference different type fibre clear use practice largely What action Commission take ensure long short fibre flax pointlessly separated new definition What Commission propose ensure good condition cultivation processing fibre flax Finland elsewhere How Commission propose protect development flax cultivation processing prospect part Finnish agriculture,ELDR,Finland,The Commissions proposal for a new EU regulation on flax fibre creates problem for Finland because it proposes that the production of flax for fibre should be made subject to a quota based on quantity cultivated in the past In Finland the growing of flax for fibre ha hitherto been a smallscale operation The growing of flax for fibre is only in it infancy in Finland and this is why the amount cultivated in recent year ha been small at only a few thousand hectare per year At present Finnish agriculture is undergoing a structural change with farm being forced to diversify into new direction and find new profitable form of crop One promising alternative seems to be the production of fibre flax a plant which suit Finnish condition very well We have had perhectare yield of the same order a in the best growing area in the EU and the cultivation of flax for fibre is therefore expected to increase considerably in the future The imposition of quota is the worst thing that could happen to Finnish flax production at this juncture At least three new flax processing plant are currently being built in Finland which will require in total by way of raw material the yield of at least to hectare of flax If the Commissions new flax regulation is implemented in it current form it will deprive u of the opportunity to expand domestic cultivation and the new factory will thus have to operate with imported raw material These are not realistic condition for developing the Finnish flax industry Furthermore the requirement in the proposal that the product once made into fibre should contain not more than of shives is too strict for the Finnish insulating wool production industry The Commission proposal on subsidy also place Finland at a disadvantage in view of the low reference harvest it set for fibre flax crop since the subsidy would be partly calculated on this basis Different level of aid are proposed for the processing of long and short fibre even though the definition of the difference between the different type of fibre is not clear and their use in practice is largely the same What action will the Commission take to ensure that long and short fibre flax are not pointlessly separated from each other by these new definition What doe the Commission propose to do to ensure that there are good condition for the cultivation and processing of fibre flax in Finland a elsewhere How doe the Commission propose to protect the development of flax cultivation and processing and it prospect a a part of Finnish agriculture,Mikko Pesälä

644,The Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive THMPD EC Directive 2004/24/EC was devised by the Commission to enable the registration and sale of herbal products associated with long-standing traditional medicinal cultures under a simplified licensing regime. Since the directive was enacted in April 2004 it has been in a transitional phase in which producers and suppliers can apply to register their products via  authorities and central evaluation by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products HMPC of the European Medicines Agency.

2222,The European Commission has issued a user manual as a non-binding guide for defining small and medium-sized enterprises. Unfortunately however it is only a general guide for applying the definition and not  and generally binding rule for identifying small and medium-sized enterprises. The manual has no legal effect and is not binding on the Commission or other entities. The booklet does however refer to Commission  2003/361/EC of 20 May 2003 but this is also not a legally binding document that would entail consequences if it were not applied. Through  the EU institutions merely express their opinions and propose certain steps without imposing a legal obligation. I believe however that there should be a uniform definition of small and medium-sized enterprises especially in connection with the provision of grants to entities operating in the European Union.

1233,A recent Unicef survey shows that the EU is lagging behind in eradicating child poverty and in general in meeting the Sustainable Development Objectives SDOs 1 that have been agreed upon. Evidence shows that even in  countries on average about 1 in 5 children live in relative  poverty and 1 in 8 children face food insecurity. In particular Greece is ranked 31st of the 41 EU/OECD countries in terms of child poverty. It is estimated that 25.5 of children in Greece live in relative  poverty while 39 of children experience multidimensional poverty2. It should also be noted that higher  do not automatically lead to a diminution of child poverty as they are often  by greater inequality3.

1580,In April 2013 the newspaper Makor Rishon reported that the Palestinian Authority PA pays monthly salaries to militants serving sentences in Israeli jails. The research department of Israels Foreign Ministry discovered that at least 4 of the PAs budget 17.5 million shekels goes to jailed terrorists each month. Although former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has condemned terrorism two years ago he ordered salaries for imprisoned militants to be tripled. The Norwegian Parliament has also raised the issue since the country is one of the PAs chief donors.

He has stated I discussed this issue with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad in Ramallah on 4 April of this year 2013 when I again made it clear that Norway views aspects of this programme as problematic.

2005,Official documents and legal texts can be accessed by interested Internet users all over the world from a wide variety of EU websites. This represents a major contribution to transparency and approachability closeness to the citizen. This closeness to the citizen is diminished however by the inadequate readability of the material published on the EU websites even when available in the users own language. A test was carried out on Document A7-0171/2010 from Parliaments agenda of 11 November 20101 using a procedure which determines readability according to the Flesch formula The readability of a text is assessed by means of a scale e.g. a text scoring between 100 and 81 counts as extremely easy a score of 4031 calls for middle school education and one of 3021 for school-leaving level education while texts with a readability below 20 require degree-level education.

288,According to the  of 29.9.2011 proceedings have been initiated against Greece for infringing the Working Time Directive in respect of the working hours of doctors in public health services. However since September 2011  the Commission has done absolutely nothing while stating in its answer to Written Question E-007844/2013 that At this stage the Commission reserves the right to take all further measures which may be necessary to  with the directive.

The consequences of this are twofold the shift in traditional trade flows has led to massive increases in imports into Europe with a 520  rise in imports from Asia and a 109  rise in imports from the USA in 1998 and the concentration of markets has resulted in a fall in European exports exacerbated by a tendency towards regional protectionism.

1078,According to reports in the press the Commission has decided to propose sanctions against Portugal and Spain in the context of the excessive deficit procedure EDP. Four eurozone countries recorded public accounts deficits over the 3 ceiling in 2015 Portugal Spain France and Greece. The justification given for the proposed sanctions was that the countries concerned had failed to take sufficient measures to reduce their deficits. This could result in a fine being imposed on Portugal amounting to 0.2 of GDP around EUR 360 million with half of its structural fund support being suspended in 2017. Can the Commission confirm these reports and can it clarify what it means by sufficient measures in the case of Portugal where the social impact of four years of austerity is all too evident How does the Commission justify the double standards applied  with France which like Portugal has been in the excessive deficit procedure since 2009 but was given two more years to correct its deficit,E-004023-16,0,According report press Commission decided propose sanction Portugal Spain context excessive deficit procedure EDP Four eurozone country recorded public account deficit ceiling Portugal Spain France Greece The justification given proposed sanction country concerned failed take sufficient measure reduce deficit This could result fine imposed Portugal amounting GDP around EUR million half structural fund support suspended Can Commission confirm report clarify mean sufficient measure case Portugal social impact four year austerity evident How Commission justify double standard applied France like Portugal excessive deficit procedure since given two year correct deficit,GUE/NGL,Portugal,According to report in the press the Commission ha decided to propose sanction against Portugal and Spain in the context of the excessive deficit procedure EDP Four eurozone country recorded public account deficit over the ceiling in Portugal Spain France and Greece The justification given for the proposed sanction wa that the country concerned had failed to take sufficient measure to reduce their deficit This could result in a fine being imposed on Portugal amounting to of GDP around EUR million with half of it structural fund support being suspended in Can the Commission confirm these report and can it clarify what it mean by sufficient measure in the case of Portugal where the social impact of four year of austerity is all too evident How doe the Commission justify the double standard applied with France which like Portugal ha been in the excessive deficit procedure since but wa given two more year to correct it deficit,Miguel Viegas
177,Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds rightly points out that effective bird protection is a cross-border issue. In particular the directive requires Member States to take the measures needed to prevent the deliberate killing of birds. Given that many species are migratory they must be protected not only inside the EU but also in all the countries they fly over. One factor behind the decline in bird populations is the barbarous practice employed both in the EU Cyprus Malta Italy and in other countries in the Mediterranean basin Lebanon of killing storks and other migratory birds as they fly north from Africa.

3053,On 22 September 2004 Heineken stated that it wanted to close the Pedavena brewery Belluno despite it having operated successfully for 107 years and the quality of the beer produced there having earned considerable international recognition in recent times. It is for example the only brewery in Italy to produce beer for coeliacs people allergic to gluten. The closure was initially slated for 31 December 2004 but the unanimous response of the local provincial and regional authorities and a series of popular initiatives that culminated with the collection of over 40000 signatures more than 17000 on paper and 23000 on the Internet have for the time being persuaded  to postpone the closure until 30 September 2005. The closure of this historic brewery in Pedavena would have major economic and social repercussions throughout the Belluno province since - in a scenario unique in the world of brewing - the plant is an integral part of the surrounding area and severing any part of that link would mean plunging the entire local system into crisis. For example the associated Birreria Pedavena brasserie serves over 600000 customers a year and is one of the top beerhouses in Europe. The closure of the brewery would inevitably dent its prestige and mean it having to downsize it currently provides work for around seventy people. There would also be serious repercussions for all the related activities that have sprung up around the plant and especially for tourism in the area. Therefore should it be impossible for production to continue under Heineken the brewery would need to be put up for sale without any preconditions whatsoever. In this respect according to the information gathered Heineken Italia has said it is willing to sell but has not specified any details regarding the sale except for the fact that it seems to want to systematically examine the business plan - or in other words the strategies - of each potential new investor. How can a  that intends to discontinue activity presume to be party to its successors business plan - or is this perhaps a way of discouraging prospective  Considering that Heineken Italia has already been the subject of several investigations conducted both at European level by the Commission and by the Italian antitrust authorities for abuse of a dominant position and collusive agreements and that the Dutch multinational Heineken is Europes leading beer producer does the Commission not consider that it should keep a watchful eye on the dealings in progress in accordance with Community rules,P-3527/04,0,On September Heineken stated wanted close Pedavena brewery Belluno despite operated successfully year quality beer produced earned considerable international recognition recent time It example brewery Italy produce beer coeliacs people allergic gluten The closure initially slated December unanimous response local provincial regional authority series popular initiative culminated collection signature paper Internet time persuaded postpone closure September The closure historic brewery Pedavena would major economic social repercussion throughout Belluno province since scenario unique world brewing plant integral part surrounding area severing part link would mean plunging entire local system crisis For example associated Birreria Pedavena brasserie serf customer year one top beerhouses Europe The closure brewery would inevitably dent prestige mean downsize currently provides work around seventy people There would also serious repercussion related activity sprung around plant especially tourism area Therefore impossible production continue Heineken brewery would need put sale without precondition whatsoever In respect according information gathered Heineken Italia said willing sell specified detail regarding sale except fact seems want systematically examine business plan word strategy potential new investor How intends discontinue activity presume party successor business plan perhaps way discouraging prospective Considering Heineken Italia already subject several investigation conducted European level Commission Italian antitrust authority abuse dominant position collusive agreement Dutch multinational Heineken Europes leading beer producer Commission consider keep watchful eye dealing progress accordance Community rule,ALDE,Italy,On September Heineken stated that it wanted to close the Pedavena brewery Belluno despite it having operated successfully for year and the quality of the beer produced there having earned considerable international recognition in recent time It is for example the only brewery in Italy to produce beer for coeliacs people allergic to gluten The closure wa initially slated for December but the unanimous response of the local provincial and regional authority and a series of popular initiative that culminated with the collection of over signature more than on paper and on the Internet have for the time being persuaded to postpone the closure until September The closure of this historic brewery in Pedavena would have major economic and social repercussion throughout the Belluno province since in a scenario unique in the world of brewing the plant is an integral part of the surrounding area and severing any part of that link would mean plunging the entire local system into crisis For example the associated Birreria Pedavena brasserie serf over customer a year and is one of the top beerhouses in Europe The closure of the brewery would inevitably dent it prestige and mean it having to downsize it currently provides work for around seventy people There would also be serious repercussion for all the related activity that have sprung up around the plant and especially for tourism in the area Therefore should it be impossible for production to continue under Heineken the brewery would need to be put up for sale without any precondition whatsoever In this respect according to the information gathered Heineken Italia ha said it is willing to sell but ha not specified any detail regarding the sale except for the fact that it seems to want to systematically examine the business plan or in other word the strategy of each potential new investor How can a that intends to discontinue activity presume to be party to it successor business plan or is this perhaps a way of discouraging prospective Considering that Heineken Italia ha already been the subject of several investigation conducted both at European level by the Commission and by the Italian antitrust authority for abuse of a dominant position and collusive agreement and that the Dutch multinational Heineken is Europes leading beer producer doe the Commission not consider that it should keep a watchful eye on the dealing in progress in accordance with Community rule,Antonio Di Pietro
2486,Over the past 10 years in Italy there has been a considerable rise in the number of foreign pupils who are not Italian nationals from 400 000 in the school year 2005-2006 to 830 000 in 2015-2016. For example there is a primary school class in Milan which consists exclusively of foreign children who do not know the Italian language at all. This phenomenon aided by the ease with which a child is placed in a class that has already been established for several years not only creates great difficulties for the new arrival but also puts teachers in a difficult position it is a  matter for foreign children to shift from their mother tongue to Italian especially with regard to phonetic structure this means that teachers are finding it impossible to conclude their scheduled teaching programmes.

1351,Reportedly one of the main points of friction between the Greek Government and the Troika in the negotiations to evaluate the Greek programme is the demand by lenders to reduce employers contributions to pension funds by about 4.

2140,It has been claimed at the beginning of January 2011 by the organisation Young Farmers and Stockbreeders of Catalonia JARC  www.jarc.es that slaughterhouses are not observing the prices agreed at a professional meeting in Bellpuig LÊ©rida Catalonia. That meeting in Catalonia set a price of EUR 1.65/kg per carcass of rabbit but the slaughterhouse price ignoring that decision is an average of EUR 1.35/kg. That price is of course EUR 0.35/kg lower than the production cost price which is between EUR 1.70 and 1.80/kg. In other words production costs are not even covered even though they are continually rising. This jeopardises the continuity of holdings and food self-sufficiency. Article 102 of the Treaty prohibits abusive business practices  occupying a dominant market position. This is made clear in paragraphs a and b of that article.

1071,According to Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament traditional herbal medicinal products should be registered as of 30 April 2011. The regulation plans to impose the same testing requirements on traditional herbal medicinal products as on newly developed chemical products or artificially concentrated natural substances. For herbal preparations to be registered and marketed concrete evidence will thus have to be provided of their effectiveness safety and side effects. It should be noted that these clinical trials are expensive and  than for  because the effects of herbal medicinal products are generally due to  of ingredients  rather than a single active ingredient  and it is not always possible to conduct clinical trials on herbal medicines.

At present the association is seeking to implement a project centring on a taxi service for wheelchair-bound people with disabilities services of this type are not yet widely available in Rome. The association is accordingly aiming to assemble a fleet of taxis adapted to carry disabled passengers which would operate under a full renting arrangement and at a lower cost per kilometre in conjunction with a radio-taxi service with vehicle monitoring and management systems including satellite-based GPS positioning to handle calls giving priority to calls from people with disabilities. Furthermore the Biga Roma project is to include cars specially adapted to be driven by disabled people with all the necessary municipal authorisations in accordance with the new highway code this would create new job opportunities for the differently abled and help to encourage their employment in the Rome area. A project of this kind if implemented would provide the City of Rome with an essential welfare service as well as promoting the social integration of the more disadvantaged.

2998,During the course of contacts made by the delegation of MEPs on the margins of the 64th meeting of the EUTurkey Joint Parliamentary Committee Istanbul 25-26 May 2010 a number of human rights organisations drew our attention once more to the case of Pinar Selek. This sociologist activist who is particularly engaged in the field of human and social rights has been prosecuted in Turkey since 1998 for a bomb attack in the Spice Market in Istanbul although forensic experts established from the very outset that the explosion was caused by a gas leak and not a bomb. It should be pointed out that Ms Selek was working at the time on an anti-militaristic study and refused to reveal her sources to the police. Since this is essentially a political rather than a legal matter and given that the EU  to protecting human rights defenders worldwide will the Commission say 1.

2657,At a time when work is about the begin on the construction sites in the area enclosed within Romps main orbital link G.R.A. with a view to building the Rome to Naples high-speed line and laying a second track on the FM2 line there are still many unresolved problems which have to do with the question whether entire districts of Rome will be bearable places to live in the future. In particular the matter of the damage to be inflicted on the hundreds of people who will have to live cheek by jowl with the railway on which about two hundred trains a day are expected to run at top speeds of 200 k.p.h. has to date been dealt with in a way giving rise to difficulties and discrimination. The only official document enabling the damage resulting from the high-speed line to be quantified in advance is the memorandum of understanding between TAV and Latium Region which lays  in respect of buildings situated not more than 30 m from the outer track of the high-speed line. However this memorandum applies only to the area lying outside the G.R.A. The area enclosed within the G.R.A. which ought to be covered by an agreement between TAV and the City of Rome has been dealt with under a unilateral document called the Guidelines drawn up by TAV which provides  for those whose homes border on the high-speed line and the corresponding construction sites. The use of different methods has led to various instances of unequal treatment and discrimination which have halved the number and size of  payments. Furthermore there is no mention of environmental impact assessments or works to offset the damage. 1. Can the Commission say whether there are any directives imposing an obligation to harmonise memorandums of understanding of this kind 2.
