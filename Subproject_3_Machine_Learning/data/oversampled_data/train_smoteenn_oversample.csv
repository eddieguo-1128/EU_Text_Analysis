0,High-voltage power lines 380 kV have been erected in the area of Setteville Nord in the municipality of Guidonia Montecelio. There are particular reports of a power line which runs too close to residential buildings. In some places the power cable runs at a height of 20 metres above ground level passing above the parking spaces alongside the dwellings. In addition given that the dwellings have been built in an upwardly sprawling manner the result has been a gradual reduction in the distances between the cable and the walls of the houses. This issue is therefore causing great alarm among the areas inhabitants particularly as  with the rules governing protection from exposure to electromagnetic fields. Given that the priority of the European Union is to safeguard the health of its citizens can the Commission 1. State whether it is aware of the situation 2. Indicate whether this situation is in breach of the European provisions regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields in particular  1999/519/EC Directive 1999/5/EC and Directive 2006/95/EC 3. Illustrate what actions can be put in place to prevent any potential immediate or long-term biological damage as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields 4.

1,Five years ago a pan-European multilingual  platform called Presseurop was created with the aim of providing information about Europe translated into 10 languages taken from news items published in major European and international newspapers. The Commission supported this interesting project providing resources and signing a five-year contract with the successful tenderer. This contract expires on 20 December 2013 and Presseurop will be forced to close because the Commission appears to have chosen to assign these resources to other initiatives. As far as I have been able to ascertain the Commission cancelled at the last minute a tender to continue with projects like the one now ending despite Parliament having approved funds to finance such projects this year. I fear that such a change of course may undermine the idea of European citizenship to which we all aspire especially now when the  European elections are so close at hand and encouraging citizen involvement is one of their main objectives as seen in the Action.

2,According to critical media reports the planned amendments in the area of air passenger rights significantly reduce the current level of protection for passengers. According to the Commissions proposal passengers would have the right to apply  only in the event of a longer delay than is currently the case.

26,The Spanish Government introduced a tax amnesty scheme to help regularise capital stating that the origins of undeclared money would not be investigated. This scheme ran from 30 March to 30 November 2012 and the Spanish Finance Minister recently stated that some EUR 40 000 million had been declared. A tax amnesty of this nature involves the regularisation of capital from illegal activities about which no information is available. This means that all sorts of money from unknown sources has been awarded a premium in the form of a ridiculous 10 tax rate as opposed to the rate of almost 50 on average that ordinary people have to pay on their earnings. Despite the extremely serious allegations of corruption that have been made in connection with this amnesty the Finance Minister maintained that of the EUR 40 000 million that had been declared approximately EUR 1 193 million had been collected for the public purse. This amount would represent a 3 tax contribution on the regularised capital in contrast to the 10 the Minister mentioned in March when he launched the tax amnesty. This implies that the collection plans were false and that the defrauders had been offered other arrangements or that less money has been regularised than the government suggests.

48,Energy independence is of strategic importance to the EU. Oil and gas security of supply should therefore be considered as a priority by the Commission and the Member States. The Nabucco gas pipeline should contribute to this energy independence. By circumventing Russia it will make it possible to diversify Europes sources of supply and limit its dependence on the Russian gas giant Gazprom which holds a monopoly of exports originating in and transiting through Russia. However recent developments suggest that Gazprom will play an important part in the Nabucco project. The Austrian gas group OMV has concluded an association agreement with Gazprom altering the shareholder base of the Central European Gas Hub CEGH which manages the Baumgarten distribution platform. This platform is Nabuccos arrival point. Under the agreement 30  of  shares will be held by OMV 30  by Gazprom 20  by Wiener BÊ_rse and 20  by Centrex. Centrex is a  owned by Robert Nowikovsky known to be close to Andrei Akimov Gazprombanks CEO. This means that Gazprom will to all intents and purposes control 50  of CEGH. This situation poses a serious threat to EU energy independence. In addition to the Nabucco project Gazprom could thus control the platform through which a third of its gas exports to the EU transit.

63,Written question E-2303/011 raised with the Commission the issue of the problems suffered by island regions that are not among the most remote regions in the Community but are nonetheless separate from mainland Europe and  is  by the fact that they incur much higher transport costs than firms situated on mainland Europe and by their lack of access to railways motorways and other overland transport systems with this representing a serious handicap in the free-trade area that is the EUs single market. The question proposed that one of the functions of European agencies was to facilitate the operation of the European single market by acting as regulators offering various services to industrial sectors etc. and that the setting-up of a European agency for islands was a necessary and appropriate step  for non-remote island regions lack of access to the free-trade area. It was pointed out that such an agency would also be able to provide assistance on technical matters in connection with the very specific problems experienced by island regions and that more than 14 million people in Europe live in island regions. The Commission was asked for its views on the fact that it was difficult for certain European regions to benefit on equal terms from one of the EUs key principles  that of the free market and   and whether it agreed that a European agency for islands should be set up. The Commission replied that it had initiated a study of the situation of islands in the Union and that as part of this study a database on island regions would be set up and their situation analysed objectively which would involve  analysis and evaluation of the problems arising from the geographical position of islands and of their special needs.

64,The Asian hornet Vespa velutina which arrived in Aquitaine in 2004 has since been spreading steadily in France and decimating bee populations on which it preys. This is yet another cause  along with factors such the intensive use of pesticides  of the mass death of bees. Bees play a crucial role in plant pollination their activity accounting for no less than 35  of our food diversity. Given the speed at which it is spreading the Asian hornet could soon pose a problem Europe-wide. Effective steps to halt its advance must therefore be taken as quickly as possible. There is unanimity among beekeepers that sulphur dioxide SO is the only product currently identified as being effective in destroying Asian hornet nests. It is a substance that must be used in accordance with strict rules but its period of residual activity is much shorter than that of insecticides. However using it against the Asian hornet is currently banned because it is not listed in the European Register for Biocidal  introduced under Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market. The ban means that much more harmful substances have to be used including pesticides such as Proteus use of which is actually prohibited in Germany and Italy or Dipter.

Part of the problem is the shifting balance of ethnicities in the Serbian province of Vojvodina where according to data for 2011 Serbs make up more than 66 of the population and are thus at present the largest ethnic group. Observations indicate however that efforts are under way  involving neighbouring Croatia in particular  to accelerate immigration to Vojvodina notably by Roma from former Yugoslavia and Albanians from Kosovo and to promote their settlement there.

However it is scarcely recognized as a building material in those countries where it has not traditionally been used.

83,For the last five weeks 237 migrants have been on a hunger strike in the centre of Athens demanding papers from the PASOK government that will make them legal in the country. The hunger-striking migrants who have been working in Greece for years had the lawful papers but today cannot renew them because of the capitalist crisis. Some hunger strikers have already been transferred to hospitals in Athens with serious health problems while the rest who are continuing the hunger strike face immediate and serious risks to their health and life. We express our unwavering support for the justified struggle of the hunger-striking migrants. Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants who found themselves in Greece out of a need to survive owing to military interventions civil wars or tyrannical regimes are now trapped in that country although their final destination is another EU Member State owing to the Dublin II Regulation without rights under unacceptable and inhumane conditions as hostages subject to extremely severe exploitation.

94,The visa requirements for Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro have been lifted by the European Union since 19 December 2009 after it was established that these countries met a number of conditions including biometric passports and enhanced border controls. In practical terms that means that residents of these countries are now free to travel around Europe. I have heard from various sources that the national immigration services are seeing a massive upsurge in applications for asylum from these countries. I have been given a figure of 150 000 Macedonians who have applied for asylum in an EU Member State in just three months. In Belgium for example the federal agency for the reception of asylum-seekers Fedasil said that in the second-last week of February around 200 people had to be turned away because of a lack of space. According to the Belgian Commissioner-Generals Office for Refugees this is caused by a large influx from Serbia and Macedonia. The figures bear out what Fedasil says. 1 184 individual applications for asylum were received in January 2010 some 200 more than for the same month in 2009. 201 Macedonians submitted an application for asylum in the whole of 2009. In January 2010 alone there were already 60 applications from Macedonians putting Macedonia in eighth place in the Belgian rankings just ahead of Serbia 58. This month February 360 applications have already been received from Serbia and Macedonia. There is therefore a significant increase. Against this background would the Commission please answer the following questions Is the Commission aware of this increase What figures does the Commission have at its disposal on this matter If the Commission is not aware of this development does it intend to monitor the trends in the number of applications for asylum by immigrants from Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro Does the Commission consider it acceptable that Member States are confronted with a significant increase in the number of applications for asylum as the result of a European decision to abolish the visa requirement for countries such as Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro When reaching its decision to abolish the visa requirement did the Commission take into account an increase in the influx of asylum-seekers from Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro If so has the Commission taken  measures to assist the Member States in processing the increase in the number of applications for asylum Which  measures If not why not,E-1205/10,0,The visa requirement for Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro have been lifted by the European Union since December after it wa established that these country met a number of condition including biometric passport and enhanced border control In practical term that mean that resident of these country are now free to travel around Europe I have heard from various source that the national immigration service are seeing a massive upsurge in application for asylum from these country I have been given a figure of Macedonians who have applied for asylum in an EU Member State in just three month In Belgium for example the federal agency for the reception of asylumseekers Fedasil said that in the secondlast week of February around people had to be turned away because of a lack of space According to the Belgian CommissionerGenerals Office for Refugees this is caused by a large influx from Serbia and Macedonia The figure bear out what Fedasil say individual application for asylum were received in January some more than for the same month in Macedonians submitted an application for asylum in the whole of In January alone there were already application from Macedonians putting Macedonia in eighth place in the Belgian ranking just ahead of Serbia This month February application have already been received from Serbia and Macedonia There is therefore a significant increase Against this background would the Commission please answer the following question Is the Commission aware of this increase What figure doe the Commission have at it disposal on this matter If the Commission is not aware of this development doe it intend to monitor the trend in the number of application for asylum by immigrant from Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro Does the Commission consider it acceptable that Member States are confronted with a significant increase in the number of application for asylum a the result of a European decision to abolish the visa requirement for country such a Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro When reaching it decision to abolish the visa requirement did the Commission take into account an increase in the influx of asylumseekers from Macedonia Serbia and Montenegro If so ha the Commission taken measure to assist the Member States in processing the increase in the number of application for asylum Which measure If not why not,-0.2508324,-0.2508324
95,The Saxon regional government and the Czech government are planning to build a new section of railway between Dresden and Prague. To do this they intend to include funds from the Connecting Europe Facility. According to the German Government the project has a cost-benefit ratio of 1.3 but there are doubts as to the projects economic viability. In order to achieve the target 52-minute journey time between Dresden and Prague the 56 km stretch between Dresden and Usti nad Labem is being designed for a maximum speed of 200 km/h and the 80 km Czech stretch between Usti nad Labem and Prague is being designed for a speed of 350 km/h. However this means that speeds of over 230 km/h would only be possible on an eighth of the EC route between Hamburg and Prague. Given that trains designed for speeds of over 249 km/h entail considerably higher costs in terms of procurement and operations having them run on this route would appear to be economically unviable and therefore unlikely. 1.

101,On 31 July 2012 the 2006 Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement FPA between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania expires. After five rounds of negotiations there is a certain degree of pessimism over whether a new protocol will actually be adopted to enable fishing to continue in Mauritanian waters. Failure to renew the Protocol would affect many Community vessels notably 24 Galician boats which along with Italian Greek and Portuguese vessels currently fish in the area concerned. The Galician fleet is particularly concerned as the successive Protocols that have been adopted have reduced its presence in those waters by 15 vessels from 39 ships in 2006 to the current total of 24.

108,In the final declaration of the Euro-African summit of July 2006 it was stated in general terms that the African leaders agreed to cooperate with the EU Member States to repatriate any of their nationals who were residing in the EU illegally. Many of the black Africans who for example have reached the shores of the Canaries this year are said to have been released because Spain either could not ascertain their country of origin or did not have an agreement on the repatriation of nationals with the country concerned. A Spanish official who wished to remain anonymous has said that these black Africans knew very well which countries had repatriation agreements and which did not.

109,A few days ago the Italian press reported an alleged case of fraud against the EU consisting in the fact that Community funding was unduly paid to businesses in the province of Pistoia in 2000 and 2001. Investigations carried out by the Guardia di Finanza Italian financial police show that in Pistoia and Valdinievole alone 300 out of 320 agricultural holdings did not meet the requirements for Community funding. For this reason four officials of the provincial authority of Pistoia were reported to the Court of Auditors in Florence accused of having allocated more than EUR 7 million to holdings that did not meet the legal requirements and failing to carry out the appropriate controls and checks on the documentation produced. European legislation stipulates that every new farmer may be granted a payment of between EUR 20 000 and 25 000 upon presentation of documentary proof that they have started up a business on condition that the business is not suspended earlier than four years after the payment is granted. However it emerged that almost all the beneficiaries were not new businesses but had already been operating for a long time. In view of this can the Commission say 1. whether it was informed of these facts 2. how it intends to recover the sums unduly paid 3. whether the funding will remain available for the province of Pistoia or whether it will be returned to the Commission 4. how it came about that the Region of Tuscany and the Province of Pistoia did not manage to ensure that the Community funding available was allocated correctly,E-3260/07,0,A few day ago the Italian press reported an alleged case of fraud against the EU consisting in the fact that Community funding wa unduly paid to business in the province of Pistoia in and Investigations carried out by the Guardia di Finanza Italian financial police show that in Pistoia and Valdinievole alone out of agricultural holding did not meet the requirement for Community funding For this reason four official of the provincial authority of Pistoia were reported to the Court of Auditors in Florence accused of having allocated more than EUR million to holding that did not meet the legal requirement and failing to carry out the appropriate control and check on the documentation produced European legislation stipulates that every new farmer may be granted a payment of between EUR and upon presentation of documentary proof that they have started up a business on condition that the business is not suspended earlier than four year after the payment is granted However it emerged that almost all the beneficiary were not new business but had already been operating for a long time In view of this can the Commission say whether it wa informed of these fact how it intends to recover the sum unduly paid whether the funding will remain available for the province of Pistoia or whether it will be returned to the Commission how it came about that the Region of Tuscany and the Province of Pistoia did not manage to ensure that the Community funding available wa allocated correctly,-0.44432205,-0.44432205

Discounting prices to large customers is against EU regulations. The Lynemouth Northumberland plant generates its own electricity from its own coal-fired plant but EU bureaucrats have decreed that it fails  with the Large Combustion Plants Directive and must close.

123,According to Eurostat the population of EU-15 rose in 2003 by 1 276 200 to 380.8 million with 982 600 persons or 77 of this growth being made up of immigrants to the EU mainly from third world countries. At the same time the Head of the UN Population Office Joseph Chamie has published information showing that the EUs population figures have been on the decline since 1998. Joseph Chamies statement is then used to claim that the EU needs immigration from third-world countries. A negative population trend has indeed been recorded in certain east and central European countries and if Russia Ukraine and Belarus are counted as part of Europe there has been a slight fall in the population figure for the European area as a whole although this is clearly not the case for EU-15. It is well known that the immigration flows from the third world are directed towards EU-15 in particular. In addition the Commissions own analyses have concluded that the changes in the age structure of the population in the years  mean that the EU will need to see a larger proportion of the active age groups entering the labour market and remaining there longer because immigrants from the third world cannot as a general rule replace the skilled Europeans who leave the labour market early or stay away from it altogether.

126,A recent survey by the FAO has revealed that consumption of milk and dairy products could help to improve the nutritional level of millions of impoverished persons throughout the world. These products are in fact a major energy source and contain calcium vitamin D and proteins which influence bone health. They are also rich in micronutrients which are fundamental  malnutrition in the poorest populations whose diet frequently consists predominantly of cereals and carbohydrates primarily as part of a non-varied diet. It has also been demonstrated that milk and dairy products can help in the prevention of certain types of tumour and some diet-related transmissible diseases such as type-2 diabetes. Obviously these foods are rich in fats and should be consumed as part of a balanced diet. In spite of their undeniable benefits the research undertaken has revealed that milk and dairy products are still too costly for the poorest families. Considering that  it is predicted that the consumption of such products in developing countries will increase by 2025 as a result of population growth and rising  but that such food will continue to be beyond the reach of the poorest families  the milk/dairy produce sector is the cause of around 4 of all greenhouse gas emissions and also has an impact on soil and water resources  small-scale dairy production can be instigated by optimising local resources with a view to sustainability through modest improvements in production and technologies. The Commission is asked whether 1. In the context of aid directed at developing countries it is expedient to invest in programmes to increase milk and dairy produce consumption by impoverished families 2. It would consider implementing policies to help impoverished families embark on small-scale dairy production 3.

128,In Italy their trading volume is equivalent to around EUR 400 billion of insured securities namely 20 of government debt. But in reality according to the experts the figures are contradictory and the market is opaque because naked CDSs are also being traded i.e. are being used purely for speculative purposes without an underlying insured Btp Italian Government bond. This involves great risks. This huge financial betting market is made possible by the lack of relevant legislation and the fact that it is oligopolistic i.e. run by only a few operators. These CDSs can be bought and sold  and this is the most disturbing aspect of it all  even without holding any Btps. At the top of the CDS market is Italy followed by Spain France and Germany.

129,The European Union has recently intervened in the methods by which Member States are to calculate their gross domestic product and transmit the data to Eurostat. The new method is called Accounts 2010. The revision will consider certain new entries as sources of revenue and no longer only as expenditure thereby increasing the total value of GDP. By way of example expenditure on research and development will no longer be recorded under current expenditure but under investment giving rise to an increase in the final calculation as with expenditure on weapon systems. Another change relates to the accounting for goods sent abroad for processing in other stages of the production cycle which will no longer be recorded under import-export and the fact that new methods will also be introduced to calculate the cost of pension schemes and the weighting of the insurance sector. In view of the new Accounts 2010 method can the Commission clarify 1. whether the virtual increase in GDP which this would give rise to may have significant effects on the public finance objectives of Member States 2. to what extent the effects of the new method will vary from country to country and whether any differences may create inequalities or difficulties for some Member States,E-000753-14,0,The European Union ha recently intervened in the method by which Member States are to calculate their gross domestic product and transmit the data to Eurostat The new method is called Accounts The revision will consider certain new entry a source of revenue and no longer only a expenditure thereby increasing the total value of GDP By way of example expenditure on research and development will no longer be recorded under current expenditure but under investment giving rise to an increase in the final calculation a with expenditure on weapon system Another change relates to the accounting for good sent abroad for processing in other stage of the production cycle which will no longer be recorded under importexport and the fact that new method will also be introduced to calculate the cost of pension scheme and the weighting of the insurance sector In view of the new Accounts method can the Commission clarify whether the virtual increase in GDP which this would give rise to may have significant effect on the public finance objective of Member States to what extent the effect of the new method will vary from country to country and whether any difference may create inequality or difficulty for some Member States,0.062390193,0.062390193

Can the Commission confirm that one of the conditions laid down for the granting of financial aid to fisheries projects by the EU is that a fish-stock survey must be carried out but that according to the scientists involved the fish stocks recorded by the WRFB in the spring of 1996 with the aid of gillnets did  up with enough pike to support the theory that there were too many pike in Lough Mask after which pike were caught in their spawning grounds and added to the number recorded for the lake 3. Can the Commission also confirm that one of the conditions laid down for the granting of financial aid to fisheries projects by the EU is that an investigation must be carried out into water quality and that the survey published in January 1997 by the Corrib Angling Federation entitled Lough Corrib - a cause for concern led to the conclusion that the arctic char Salvelinus alpinus which is not a prey for pike was disappearing from the lake and that the water quality was such as to make the permanent survival of salmon and trout virtually impossible thereby providing absolute justification for measures designed to bring about a sharp improvement in water quality 4. Is the Commission aware that according to the survey concerning Lake Corrib referred to in point 3 above in the spring of 1997 the WRFB simply went ahead with the wholesale removal of pike  with the condition laid down for the granting of a subsidy that fish caught in nets should be released into other lakes and  about its action subsequently resulted in the programme being suspended in September 1997 5.

Furthermore other businesses separate from these operators offer added value services such as weather forecasts information on financial operations or search  etc. for which the user pays separately from the fee paid to the digital operator. Clients who require specific services may when sending messages abroad find themselves obliged to pay tariffs which reflect the fact that they are clearly being treated differently  and prejudicially  with Internet users.

141,The importance of the European dried fodder sector rests not only on its fundamental role as a source of high-quality proteins but also because the processing of these crops carried out at local level constitutes an effective contribution to the rural development of many European regions. Alfalfa growing which the industry helps to boost has beneficial environmental effects. It requires less use of phytosanitary products there is no need for nitrates and it improves the structure of the soil by protecting it from erosion. Plants which like alfalfa help to stabilise nitrogen in the soil  climate change loss of biodiversity and the pollution of natural resources. The Commission is carrying out a study to assess the COM in dried fodder with a view to a possible revision in 2008. Nonetheless it appears that the study in question is not taking adequate account of the different atmospheric conditions which obtain in the 27 Member States and the low levels of rainfall which some Member States unfortunately suffer from which makes dry farming cultivation of this kind of fodder unviable.

147,One of Italys most popular weekly magazines recently published worrying figures concerning the number of rats found in Italys largest cities. According to the magazine there are 15 million rats in Rome 13 million in Milan and 10 million in Naples. Across the country there are 500 million rats which together eat 20 million tonnes of food each year. The article also quotes veterinarians who believe that most of the rats are infected with the plague. People are not at risk fortunately because they hardly  into contact with the rats themselves or the fleas which transmit the disease. Nonetheless the fact that everincreasing numbers of Italians are in dire financial straits and that many of them are forced to sleep on the streets rummage through bins for food and have little chance of receiving medical attention and maintaining proper personal hygiene could increase the risk of new infections. 1.

172,The EU has been taken by surprise by Armenias decision to join a trade and political union with Russia rather than opting for the EU alternative. Yerevans decision to join the Eurasian Union is more important from a political point of view than an economic one. It represents a blow to EU interests in the region and illustrates the EUs incapacity to support those interests with concrete actions. This  represents yet another example of EU eastern policy fiascos following the implementation of the misguided principle of more for more. For neighbouring countries faced with threats and alternative opportunities this principle is pushing them to give more to those who pressure them more in the present rather than to those who promise them more in an indefinite future. In the light of these developments and the increasing pressure placed by Russia on the Eastern Partnership countries the VP/HR is kindly requested to answer the following questions 1. Does the VP/HR agree that it is the EUs failure to promote its vital interests in the Eastern Neighbourhood by means of specific action based on geopolitical considerations that has prompted Armenia to join the Eurasian Union 2.

174,A Texan  AleAnna Resources has applied for a permit to explore Italys Veneto region more specifically the area between the town of Rovigo and the city of Venice. The object of the exploration is to determine whether there are methane deposits with a view ultimately to starting extraction drilling in 2015.  has given an assurance that all the necessary operations will be conducted entirely in accordance with the law and without damaging the environment. However the local political authorities and citizens living in the area point out that the earlier gas extraction between 1938 and 1964 is the direct cause of the numerous floods that have occurred in recent decades in which about 100 people have died and 180 000 have been forced to move away for good. The drilling carried out at that time has lowered the ground level by 3.5 metres increasing vulnerability to the encroachment of adjoining waters. That being the case the local authorities and citizens fear that fresh drilling will further destabilise the ground creating the worst possible conditions as regards future flooding. In addition the vibrations caused by exploration instruments could amplify the present telluric movement producing more earthquakes like the one that has already struck the region in summer 2011. Bearing these points in mind citizens and the local authorities have decided to oppose the  plans. Two mayors have even said that they have never been informed about the project in question although AleAnna Resources maintains that it submitted an application in the proper form.

176,According to my information the Commission has this autumn received a letter from the Flemish Government listing a number of measures taken since the end of 2006 to prevent by-catches of porpoises in gillnets by recreational fishermen. Porpoises are a protected species listed in Annex II to the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC1. Despite the measures taken at least two more porpoises died because of recreational use of gillnets in the first half of 2007. There are strong indications that the true figure was more than two. Although according to the official record few porpoises were killed by recreational fishing on the coast of Flanders during this period it should not automatically be deduced from this that the problem has now been solved by the measures which Flanders has taken. Porpoises do not invariably visit the coast of Flanders each year and what is more the size of their population varies from year to year. Thus the measures which have been taken are evidently not sufficient to entirely eliminate by-catches of porpoises by recreational fishermen. Does the Commission agree that fishing purely for pleasure must not on any account result in the death of protected marine mammals and if so will it ban recreational fishing with gillnets until a system has been devised which absolutely safeguards the welfare of porpoises What measures will the Commission take in relation to the Flemish authorities If the Commission does not wish to consider a ban on gillnets on what grounds does it assign higher priority to the individual hobby of a handful of people than to protecting biodiversity in general,E-5890/07,0,According to my information the Commission ha this autumn received a letter from the Flemish Government listing a number of measure taken since the end of to prevent bycatch of porpoise in gillnets by recreational fisherman Porpoises are a protected specie listed in Annex II to the Habitats Directive EEC Despite the measure taken at least two more porpoise died because of recreational use of gillnets in the first half of There are strong indication that the true figure wa more than two Although according to the official record few porpoise were killed by recreational fishing on the coast of Flanders during this period it should not automatically be deduced from this that the problem ha now been solved by the measure which Flanders ha taken Porpoises do not invariably visit the coast of Flanders each year and what is more the size of their population varies from year to year Thus the measure which have been taken are evidently not sufficient to entirely eliminate bycatch of porpoise by recreational fisherman Does the Commission agree that fishing purely for pleasure must not on any account result in the death of protected marine mammal and if so will it ban recreational fishing with gillnets until a system ha been devised which absolutely safeguard the welfare of porpoise What measure will the Commission take in relation to the Flemish authority If the Commission doe not wish to consider a ban on gillnets on what ground doe it assign higher priority to the individual hobby of a handful of people than to protecting biodiversity in general,-0.296993,-0.296993

178,Ahead of negotiations next year on a climate plan to reduce Denmarks CO2 emissions Denmarks Social Democratic Party is preparing a proposal providing for a reform of the Danish car duty system so that Danish drivers drive smaller and environment-friendlier models. The proposal seeks to double Danish registration duty on all cars  under energy class A. That would make them over 50  more expensive. The funds would be used to make the most energy-friendly models in energy class A cheaper. This may ultimately be a problem for the many Danish families which would like to own a car. For instance a two-adult two-child family wanting to buy a family-friendly car such as a new Toyota Avensis which according to the Danish Car Importers Association is one of the 10 most sold cars in Denmark may end up being hit by the new duty since that particular  under energy class B. That means that the family concerned would have to pay not only the new duty but also the customary vehicle excise duty and registration duty at 180 . Is the Commission aware of the Danish proposal to introduce a duty on cars which are not energy-friendly Does the Commission consider that doubling the registration duty for energy classes B-G would be contrary to Article 281 of the TFEU which refers to prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports In a case against the Danish Government C-47/88 the Commission made it clear that the Danish registration duty levied on new motor vehicles is  with Article 95 of the Treaty since because of its very high level and in the absence of domestic production  the free movement of goods in  market and does not form part of the framework of the general system of taxation in Denmark. In the light of this can the Commission accept the fact that the present Danish Government has been giving thought to disregarding its obligations concerning that article Does the Commission consider that the principles governing the Courts judgment at the time still apply or does it consider that the provisions of the Treaty ought to be interpreted differently because actual circumstances have changed Does the Commission agree that a duty on this scale would have an adverse impact on car sales and at the same time  among European car makers,E-009941/2011,0,Ahead of negotiation next year on a climate plan to reduce Denmarks CO emission Denmarks Social Democratic Party is preparing a proposal providing for a reform of the Danish car duty system so that Danish driver drive smaller and environmentfriendlier model The proposal seek to double Danish registration duty on all car under energy class A That would make them over more expensive The fund would be used to make the most energyfriendly model in energy class A cheaper This may ultimately be a problem for the many Danish family which would like to own a car For instance a twoadult twochild family wanting to buy a familyfriendly car such a a new Toyota Avensis which according to the Danish Car Importers Association is one of the most sold car in Denmark may end up being hit by the new duty since that particular under energy class B That mean that the family concerned would have to pay not only the new duty but also the customary vehicle excise duty and registration duty at Is the Commission aware of the Danish proposal to introduce a duty on car which are not energyfriendly Does the Commission consider that doubling the registration duty for energy class BG would be contrary to Article of the TFEU which refers to prohibition between Member States of custom duty on import and export In a case against the Danish Government C the Commission made it clear that the Danish registration duty levied on new motor vehicle is with Article of the Treaty since because of it very high level and in the absence of domestic production the free movement of good in market and doe not form part of the framework of the general system of taxation in Denmark In the light of this can the Commission accept the fact that the present Danish Government ha been giving thought to disregarding it obligation concerning that article Does the Commission consider that the principle governing the Courts judgment at the time still apply or doe it consider that the provision of the Treaty ought to be interpreted differently because actual circumstance have changed Does the Commission agree that a duty on this scale would have an adverse impact on car sale and at the same time among European car maker,-0.50591046,-0.50591046

The EFSA opinion published in January 2015 concluded that BPA does not pose any health risk to consumers of any group at the current levels of exposure. Notwithstanding this clear scientific conclusion uncertainty remains among consumers and businesses because of the diverging national measures that run counter to the most recent international scientific assessments.

As a result of this intensive work has been underway in Austria since 2012 to set clear criteria for how level crossings should be secured based on volume of traffic on the road in question maximum speed on the section of track and visibility at the level crossing. Furthermore the number of open level crossings was reduced from 5 370 to 3 712 between 2007 and 2011. This has helped to reduce the number of accidents and casualties. 1.

190,Last year I asked the Commission about discrimination against foreigners in relation to speeding fines in Belgium E-0830/011. In its answer the Commission said it would have to analyse the Belgian legislation in detail before taking a position. A year later the situation is still the same if not worse. The Belgian government has increased the amount for the out-of-court settlement of speeding offences significantly EUR 200 fine for every 10 km in excess of the speed limit. This is for foreigners. The corresponding amount for Belgians is still expressed in Belgian francs and cannot therefore be collected at all as francs are no longer legal tender. This situation is unacceptable. Last year the Belgian government announced that this matter was not one of its priorities. Following the recent reform I am forced to conclude that it is only traffic  by foreigners that are a priority and this constitutes a new form of discrimination. With a view to the White Paper on transport in which the Commission aims to harmonise penalties and checks one wonders whether it is not time to call the Belgian government to account. Things are going too far. I anticipate that the Commissions analysis of Belgian legislation will support  and I would ask the Commission now to take action. It has  to my attention that there has been a judgment C-224/00 in a similar case in Italy to which the Commission referred in its answer. Under this judgment the Italian government may no longer discriminate against people with foreign number plates. Is it not time for the European Commission to draw up an inventory of legislation on fines in the various Member States and examine whether there is also discrimination against foreigners in other countries This matter causes citizens a great deal of annoyance and inconvenience and casts doubt on the effectiveness of the Union.,P-0906/02,0,Last year I asked the Commission about discrimination against foreigner in relation to speeding fine in Belgium E In it answer the Commission said it would have to analyse the Belgian legislation in detail before taking a position A year later the situation is still the same if not worse The Belgian government ha increased the amount for the outofcourt settlement of speeding offence significantly EUR fine for every km in excess of the speed limit This is for foreigner The corresponding amount for Belgians is still expressed in Belgian franc and cannot therefore be collected at all a franc are no longer legal tender This situation is unacceptable Last year the Belgian government announced that this matter wa not one of it priority Following the recent reform I am forced to conclude that it is only traffic by foreigner that are a priority and this constitutes a new form of discrimination With a view to the White Paper on transport in which the Commission aim to harmonise penalty and check one wonder whether it is not time to call the Belgian government to account Things are going too far I anticipate that the Commissions analysis of Belgian legislation will support and I would ask the Commission now to take action It ha to my attention that there ha been a judgment C in a similar case in Italy to which the Commission referred in it answer Under this judgment the Italian government may no longer discriminate against people with foreign number plate Is it not time for the European Commission to draw up an inventory of legislation on fine in the various Member States and examine whether there is also discrimination against foreigner in other country This matter cause citizen a great deal of annoyance and inconvenience and cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Union,-0.70757985,-0.70757985

The new taxes may make it impossible for the Churches to continue to be represented in the Holy Land and they may have to abandon their pastoral ministry and their care of the needy in the fields of education and health. The new taxes flagrantly violate a legislative tradition going back to the Ottoman Empire which was retained under the British mandate and in the Kingdom of Jordan and the UN Resolution of 1947 on the foundation of the State of Israel. Currently the heads of the Christian churches in Jerusalem have joined in condemning the Israeli Government which has refused to issue a residence permit for the city to the Anglican Episcopalian bishop Suheil Dawani.

216,The toxicity and extremely hazardous nature of mercury are unanimously recognised nowadays in terms of its environmental and health impact but they remain a challenge at a global regional and national level a fact confirmed by the United Nations Environment Programme in its study entitled Global Mercury Assessment 2013. On 10 October 2013 a convention was signed in Minamata Japan on mercury use and emissions. This agreement now open to ratification by the signatory states aims to reduce global mercury emissions which are highly toxic to health and the environment and also the production and uses of mercury particularly in product manufacture and industrial processes. This convention provides in particular for products using mercury to__ eliminated by 2020 and for industrial processes to be replaced by processes which do not use mercury.

245,Writing to the environmental NGOs concerned and in document EU PILOT 184/08/ENVI the Commission concludes that the Portuguese National Potential Hydro-Electric Dams Programme PNBEPH does not violate European environmental legislation. 1. Portugal has been facing a serious problem of coastal erosion in recent years 2. This situation is essentially due to rising sea levels and the decrease in the quantity of sediments arriving at the coast 3. One of the most important factors inhibiting the carrying of sand by rivers is hydro-electricity in the shape of dams 4. The dams act as filters with almost no sand whatever reaching stretches of river downstream of the dams 5. The assessment of the cumulative effect needs to be rigorous  6. It is necessary to know what impact the PNBEPH is going to have on the regression or recession of the coastline 7. In the document referred to above the Commission says that at this stage it is not possible clearly to assess the impact on the regression or recession of the coastline due to the various factors contributing to this phenomenon.

253,Recent studies have shown that a large number of social and economic inequalities still persist in Europe. These inequalities affect the health education and productivity of European citizens. Furthermore this waste of potential means that economic growth is unable to develop its full benefits. One of the solutions experts have suggested is to consider improving the integration of migrants into society particularly on the labour market1. Given the high unemployment rate in Europe and the emergence of precarious jobs the migration crisis of the last few years has given rise to a major problem of how to integrate migrants into the labour market.

Analysis of its opinions reveals a massive difference between the number of favourable opinions granted on the one hand for claims for vitamins and minerals and on the other that concerning substances other than vitamins and minerals Other Substances. Almost all claims for Other Substances 97  have been rejected while most claims for vitamins and minerals have been approved. Evidence from reference textbooks has been deemed sufficient supporting evidence for vitamin and mineral claims but not for Other Substances. Instead for Other Substances EFSA is requiring pharmaceutical-style studies which are often impossible or extremely costly to provide. In addition evidence based on patient studies has been accepted for vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin C but not for Other Substances.

A report drawn up by the Department of Public Health at the request of the Ombudsman found that in order to properly assess the problem of child malnutrition epidemiological population studies specifically targeting the issue would have to be carried out.

270,Malaria is the most widespread of the diseases caused by parasites. Every year around 250 million cases and almost a million deaths are recorded in large part among children while between 10 000 and 30 000 visitors from Europe and America contract the disease. Bringing malaria under control requires an understanding of the biology of the parasite that is the vector for it especially since all the attempts made so far to find a cure have been hindered by the parasites ability to swiftly develop a resistance to the drugs used. The problem is that just a small difference in any of the proteins concerned is enough to ensure that the immune response which recognises one strain will not recognise another. Clinical trials and research have so far concentrated on the development of vaccines that target individual proteins in the hope of inducing a broader immune response. Recently however scientists have managed to trigger an immune response against the malaria parasite as a whole thanks to a new DNA blinding vaccine which leaves the parasite intact and prevents its multiplication. The body reacts to the vaccine as it would to a real living parasite and generates an immune response against it meaning that when the real parasite enters the bloodstream the immune system is able to neutralise it. Malaria is the most prevalent parasitic disease in the world and the second  contagious disease after tuberculosis in terms of sickness and mortality with 500 million new clinical cases and one million deaths every year 90 of these are in tropical Africa where drug resistance in the 1990s resulted in an increase in the numbers of deaths from the disease. Many of the drugs used to treat malaria have proved to be ineffective especially in rural areas of Africa. While the EU has financed several antimalaria programmes attempts to eradicate malaria have also been undermined by the developing of resistance  drugs. The studies in question have shown that the body reacts to the new vaccine as if it were a real living parasite and generates a  and effective immune response. In the light of the above can the Commission state whether it plans to include the findings of this study in a new strategy against malaria and also to pinpoint new areas in which measures should be adopted such as for example support for research into new vaccines and new antibiotics promoting local drug production in third countries and monitoring transparency in the pricing of medicines,E-008632-13,0,Malaria is the most widespread of the disease caused by parasite Every year around million case and almost a million death are recorded in large part among child while between and visitor from Europe and America contract the disease Bringing malaria under control requires an understanding of the biology of the parasite that is the vector for it especially since all the attempt made so far to find a cure have been hindered by the parasite ability to swiftly develop a resistance to the drug used The problem is that just a small difference in any of the protein concerned is enough to ensure that the immune response which recognises one strain will not recognise another Clinical trial and research have so far concentrated on the development of vaccine that target individual protein in the hope of inducing a broader immune response Recently however scientist have managed to trigger an immune response against the malaria parasite a a whole thanks to a new DNA blinding vaccine which leaf the parasite intact and prevents it multiplication The body reacts to the vaccine a it would to a real living parasite and generates an immune response against it meaning that when the real parasite enters the bloodstream the immune system is able to neutralise it Malaria is the most prevalent parasitic disease in the world and the second contagious disease after tuberculosis in term of sickness and mortality with million new clinical case and one million death every year of these are in tropical Africa where drug resistance in the s resulted in an increase in the number of death from the disease Many of the drug used to treat malaria have proved to be ineffective especially in rural area of Africa While the EU ha financed several antimalaria programme attempt to eradicate malaria have also been undermined by the developing of resistance drug The study in question have shown that the body reacts to the new vaccine a if it were a real living parasite and generates a and effective immune response In the light of the above can the Commission state whether it plan to include the finding of this study in a new strategy against malaria and also to pinpoint new area in which measure should be adopted such a for example support for research into new vaccine and new antibiotic promoting local drug production in third country and monitoring transparency in the pricing of medicine,-0.1577811,-0.1577811

Were this to happen EU cohesion policy funding for new Member States might be cut. It should be pointed out that one of the reasons for the limited scale of the economic crisis in countries such as Poland was the influx of EU funds.

291,Unlike the European Union Canada applies a risk-based approach instead of a precautionary approach. The Canadian approach appears to be less cautious with regard to human health and the environment and is not consistent with the high level of protection demanded by the approach of precautionary and preventive actions as described in Article 191 of TFEU. Canada has repeatedly criticised the approach relating to the EUs plans to protect people and the environment against endocrine-disrupting chemicals by stating that this approach would unduly impede trade. CETA encourages regulatory cooperation and the recognition of equivalent measures in the field of pest control management. Article 5.6.1 of CETA provides that the EU shall approve SPS measures which are equivalent to its own provided that they ensure an appropriate level of protection. At the same time however the terms and conditions for this will be negotiated at a later stage.

292,For a number of years there have been EU-wide rules stipulating that the single emergency call number 112 must direct calls to the public safety answering point. The emergency calls must be taken and the important emergency information forwarded to the appropriate emergency service. The public safety answering point is either part of one of the vital emergency services ambulance fire service police etc. or an interface between callers and the emergency service. In Austria the emergency call number 122 acts as a direct means of access to the fire service whereas calls to 112 are directed straight to the police. Concerns are now being raised about the fact that in Austria too the fire service will soon be integrated into the central coordination centre via the emergency number 112 and use of the number 112 sic will cease. Clarity is needed here for the purposes of the current planning work and therefore the following questions arise 1. Are any efforts being made by the Commission to introduce the mandatory use of the emergency call number 112 for the emergency services at the level of the Member States  as is the case in Germany for example 2. Is the Commission planning to make it mandatory in the Member States for the police to manage the 112 emergency call number 3.

296,From 31 March 2011 a free trade agreement is likely to exist between the EU and India. In Denmark one particularly problematic feature of this agreement is seen in the fact that it will enable Indian workers to be paid under the conditions of their country of residence India rather than those of the host country in this case Denmark. Since the EUs eastward enlargement one well-known way of circumventing our national standards for employees has been to reclassify staff as self-employed or party to a service agreement or contract which means that employees from abroad are not accorded the same rights as Danish employees. This may also happen in the future with Indian workers. The Danish trade union movement has expressed serious concern at the fact that a free trade agreement containing such provisions will lead to a direct reduction in the level of overall conditions for employees by opening the way to social dumping and pay squeezing on an unprecedented scale. Has the Commission considered this state of affairs and does the Commission recognise in this connection that it will be impossible for European employees  in terms of price if the market is opened up to a flood of Indian employees whose pay is only a fraction of the European average and if so will the Commission work towards incorporating a reasonable level of protection for European employees into a free trade agreement between India and the EU,E-002331/2011,0,From March a free trade agreement is likely to exist between the EU and India In Denmark one particularly problematic feature of this agreement is seen in the fact that it will enable Indian worker to be paid under the condition of their country of residence India rather than those of the host country in this case Denmark Since the EUs eastward enlargement one wellknown way of circumventing our national standard for employee ha been to reclassify staff a selfemployed or party to a service agreement or contract which mean that employee from abroad are not accorded the same right a Danish employee This may also happen in the future with Indian worker The Danish trade union movement ha expressed serious concern at the fact that a free trade agreement containing such provision will lead to a direct reduction in the level of overall condition for employee by opening the way to social dumping and pay squeezing on an unprecedented scale Has the Commission considered this state of affair and doe the Commission recognise in this connection that it will be impossible for European employee in term of price if the market is opened up to a flood of Indian employee whose pay is only a fraction of the European average and if so will the Commission work towards incorporating a reasonable level of protection for European employee into a free trade agreement between India and the EU,-0.20682463,-0.40947044

312,Last weekend the municipality of Serrara Fontana on the Mediterranean island of Ischia near Naples started to build a wide access road right across Monte Epomeo the highest point on the island. According to a current draft decree put forward by the national Minister of the Environment Mr Ronchi Monte Epomeo is shortly to be designated a Riserva Naturale dello Stato partly because of its great significance as a resting-place for European migratory birds. The process of declaring it a protected area however has been dragging along for months partly because local hunters fear for the future of hunting for migratory birds on Ischia. The construction work is being supported by EU funding amounting to Lit 1 billion.

315,On 1 April the abovementioned regulation entered into force. Since then it has been permitted to sell olive oil with up to 150 mg/kg of alkyl esters under the designation extra virgin/extra vergine. In Germany this has received a relatively high level of media attention. According to media reports the EU supports the sale of lower quality olive oil without any obligation for this to be mentioned on the packaging. The media have reported that the revision of the regulation has increased tolerance for alkyl esters in extra virgin/extra vergine olive oil by about 15fold. This has led to great indignation against the EU and its superfluous even harmful regulation mania which was obviously heavily influenced by pressure groups. According to the media the new limit value of 150mg/kg means that this regulation will now open up the European market to oil blends of dubious quality. However according to the experts good quality extra virgin olive oil contains only 10 to 15 mg/kg in exceptional cases up to 30 mg/kg of alkyl esters. However since in the opinion of the author of this question the limit value in question is not to be found in the old Regulation EEC No 2568/91 but has clearly been newly introduced precisely with the positive intention of preventing the sale of lower quality olive oil will the Commission answer the following questions what was the rule under Regulation EEC No 2568/91 and what is it now Is the limit value sufficient to ensure acceptable quality How was this limit value chosen The question on this issue raised by our colleague Mr Oreste Rossi on 17 March 2011 has not in my view been answered adequately because the Italian edition of the Official Journal contains merely a reference to a translation error. The issues referred to above were not addressed. Regardless of the fact that the European Parliament was not involved in taking this decision it wishes nevertheless to ask the Commission on behalf of EU citizens to provide a brief clarification.

According to information from inhabitants of Thassos4 lorries have been transporting material to the mole being constructed in the marina from the area of Vouves5 which is an historic site6and forms part of the Palataki__ Thassos __ining Complex mining monument which is a listed modern monument7 and work of art requiring special protection by the state8. Traces of ancient mining works have been found in the same area. Despite its value the area of Vouves has been misused in the past as a landfill which has not been decontaminated. This development is giving rise to reasonable concern about the changes to the relief of the historic site being caused by the extensive earthworks and the use of piles of mining spoils from previous mining activity which contain zinc lead and so forth and thus represent a risk to public health. In view of the fact that the project is being co-financed will the Commission say 1.

323,According to a recent scientific survey 50 to 125 million European citizens have been classified as energy-poor. It is unfortunately an index of social inequality and the deterioration of public health and of the environment. Energy poverty in Greek is a direct repercussion of the crisis where reduced  and increasing energy taxes make households extremely vulnerable. The issue presents a paradox although it is at the heart of European interests the EU does not take it seriously. Specifically no formal definition has been created nor are there any reliable indicators on this matter and although energy poverty is often referred to in official EU texts no binding measures have been introduced. Given that keeping this matter within  of the Member States has not mitigated the energy poverty problem in Europe will the Commission proceed with any legislative binding initiatives such as a regulation or a directive Will the EU take steps to make use of renewable energy sources and continue building energy efficiency,E-002461-17,0,According to a recent scientific survey to million European citizen have been classified a energypoor It is unfortunately an index of social inequality and the deterioration of public health and of the environment Energy poverty in Greek is a direct repercussion of the crisis where reduced and increasing energy tax make household extremely vulnerable The issue present a paradox although it is at the heart of European interest the EU doe not take it seriously Specifically no formal definition ha been created nor are there any reliable indicator on this matter and although energy poverty is often referred to in official EU text no binding measure have been introduced Given that keeping this matter within of the Member States ha not mitigated the energy poverty problem in Europe will the Commission proceed with any legislative binding initiative such a a regulation or a directive Will the EU take step to make use of renewable energy source and continue building energy efficiency,-0.2965769,-0.2965769

345,As with other production sectors the lute manufacturing sector in Europe is being threatened by Chinese production in which the instruments are assembled and then sent to Italy and other European countries so that they can be painted and the thickness regulated for sound modulation. The preferential rule of origin concerning musical instruments is enshrined in Article 24 of the Community Customs Code and existing WTO rules stipulate that in order for a given country to obtain originating status the manufacture must account for 45  of the price of the finished product. Regulation EC No 881/20031 meanwhile lays down the figure of 40  for manufacture. In the lute-manufacturing circles concerned it is deemed that these rules do not sufficiently protect the European production of musical instruments and that many producers  for instance the Italian lute manufacturing school in particular that of Cremona which is still highly regarded worldwide  risk disappearing thereby eradicating centuries of tradition and history. In view of this situation 1. why does the Commission not support in the Geneva negotiations the modification of the criteria for the recognition of originating status based on the type of work done in each individual country with regard to the manufacture of musical instruments 2. Why does the Commission not propose that the place where the instrument is finished and that of the know-how used in production be included among those criteria 3.

365,At a recent meeting with milk producers in the district of Braga Portugal I was informed that last years problems over the dairy crisis have not been resolved rather they have  worse. The cost of production factors remains high while milk prices have not risen sufficiently. This is leading to severe problems of profitability in the sector thanks to which some producers have given up dairy farming. The disappearance of farms including some medium-sized ones is happening continuously thus pointing up the inadequacy of the measures adopted by the Commission especially those referred to in its answer to my earlier question on the subject E-3847/09 July 2009.

As a result of this unrelenting crackdown on human rights key leaders of human rights organisations are behind bars as are leading journalists and other peaceful activists. Among those detained are several of the countrys most prominent human rights defenders and journalists. In addition new amendments to registration and funding laws are systematically impeding access to domestic and foreign funding inter alia by requiring government licensing of all donors and approval of each funded project which cuts off practically all funding for NGOs that seek to hold the government accountable. The amendments also provide the government with enormous discretion to dissolve impose financial penalties on and freeze the assets of civil society organisations CSOs for minor violations of existing laws. Of particular concern are provisions that prevent national organisations from accessing local cash donations and allow the government to freeze or deny international funding to domestic CSOs if an activity is judged to undermine the interests of the state.

370,Accredia is a private body designated by the Italian Government to attest  independence and impartiality of bodies and laboratories that check  of goods and services with the regulations in force. The entry into force of the 2008 EC Regulation No 765 describes this activity as the expression of public authority regardless of the legal form of individual national accreditation bodies. The presence of these superstructures shows the inadequacy of the process to streamline bureaucracy which has been hailed by the European executive. On the one hand the EU imposes  jeopardising entire sectors as in the Bolkestein case while on the other hand it invites the Member States to choose a private body at will as the sole entity responsible for accrediting the certification bodies at national level. Does the Commission not take the view that as a result of the much-trumpeted reduction of red-tape requirements the abovementioned body is in fact a private body acquiring control of a private body which makes the accreditation process even more invasive and contorted Does it not also consider that the procedure by which this private body has been designated by the Italian Government conflicts with  and with the Bolkestein Directive which has been invoked on a number of occasions by the Commission in situations which limit market choice,E-002049-18,0,Accredia is a private body designated by the Italian Government to attest independence and impartiality of body and laboratory that check of good and service with the regulation in force The entry into force of the EC Regulation No describes this activity a the expression of public authority regardless of the legal form of individual national accreditation body The presence of these superstructure show the inadequacy of the process to streamline bureaucracy which ha been hailed by the European executive On the one hand the EU imposes jeopardising entire sector a in the Bolkestein case while on the other hand it invite the Member States to choose a private body at will a the sole entity responsible for accrediting the certification body at national level Does the Commission not take the view that a a result of the muchtrumpeted reduction of redtape requirement the abovementioned body is in fact a private body acquiring control of a private body which make the accreditation process even more invasive and contorted Does it not also consider that the procedure by which this private body ha been designated by the Italian Government conflict with and with the Bolkestein Directive which ha been invoked on a number of occasion by the Commission in situation which limit market choice,-0.24307445,-0.24307445

377,The Chairman of Turkeys Advisory Board on Human Rights Mr Ibrahim Kaboglu made the remarkable statement in an interview with the Turkish newspaper Radikal on 8 November 2004 that Turkey had violated the Treaty of Lausanne in many ways and imposed restrictions on its Greek Armenian Kurdish Syro-Chaldean Jewish and other inhabitants. The interview also reports Mr Kaboglus eloquently formulated observation that democracy had been established in Turkey by all its citizens but its implementation had been restricted to one race alone the Turks. Meanwhile the Turkish Supreme Court has reportedly passed a judgment refusing to recognise the deeds of ownership held by the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the orphanage on Princes Island. The Turkish authorities unlawfully suspended the activities of the orphanage in 1964 prohibiting even basic maintenance. The Court does not recognise the deeds of ownership held by the Patriarchate on the grounds that the Ecumenical Patriarchate does not have legal personality in Turkey and cannot therefore own real property. In the Commissions view is reparation for the racist persecution and injustices to which the Jews Armenians Greeks Syro-Chaldeans Kurds etc. living in Turkey have been subjected an essential condition to be met before progress can be made on membership negotiations with Turkey if indeed it is decided to open such negotiations Is it possible for a country which systematically violates the international treaties to which it is a signatory and persecutes any religion other than Islam - as Turkish officials themselves claim - to  a member of the EU,E-2932/04,0,The Chairman of Turkeys Advisory Board on Human Rights Mr Ibrahim Kaboglu made the remarkable statement in an interview with the Turkish newspaper Radikal on November that Turkey had violated the Treaty of Lausanne in many way and imposed restriction on it Greek Armenian Kurdish SyroChaldean Jewish and other inhabitant The interview also report Mr Kaboglus eloquently formulated observation that democracy had been established in Turkey by all it citizen but it implementation had been restricted to one race alone the Turks Meanwhile the Turkish Supreme Court ha reportedly passed a judgment refusing to recognise the deed of ownership held by the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the orphanage on Princes Island The Turkish authority unlawfully suspended the activity of the orphanage in prohibiting even basic maintenance The Court doe not recognise the deed of ownership held by the Patriarchate on the ground that the Ecumenical Patriarchate doe not have legal personality in Turkey and cannot therefore own real property In the Commissions view is reparation for the racist persecution and injustice to which the Jews Armenians Greeks SyroChaldeans Kurds etc living in Turkey have been subjected an essential condition to be met before progress can be made on membership negotiation with Turkey if indeed it is decided to open such negotiation Is it possible for a country which systematically violates the international treaty to which it is a signatory and persecutes any religion other than Islam a Turkish official themselves claim to a member of the EU,0.13395144,-0.3990803

Nevertheless the Iberian gauge was is and will continue to be a basic problem for trains crossing from the French border to the Iberian one through Portbou in the Pyrenees which results in poor rail transport performance and excessive use of road transportation 20000 trucks cross the Pyrenees daily. This goes against the Commissions specific objectives with regard to improving the functioning of the internal market environmental aspects and the aim of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and  of the railway infrastructures and Mediterranean corridors particularly as regards freight transport. In its White Paper entitled European Transport Policy for 2010 the Commission highlighted its proposal  the interoperability measures featured in Directives 96/48/EC1 2001/16/EC2 and 2004/50/EC3. Furthermore with a view to the publication next year of the Commissions White Paper on the Future of Transport Johann Friedrich Colsman a member of Antonio Tajanis Cabinet stated at the 2nd European Logistics Summit conference organised in Brussels on 4 November 2009 that in the White Paper on the future of transport the Commission will have to attach great attention to inter-modality open borders for freight trains among Member States and reinforce the identified corridors. Given that the issue of the Iberian gauge is a basic problem that hinders the development and achievement of the priority projects identified by the Commission and in particular the Mediterranean freight corridor what specific measures does the Commission intend to take and what pressure will it exert on the Spanish Government in order to adapt the gauge to the European model,E-5647/09,0,Title XV of the Treaty of Maastricht obliged the European Union to set up transEuropean transport infrastructure network in order to help improve the internal market Of the key railway project identified by the Commission and the Member States throughout Europe in the TransEuropean Transport Networks TENT plan two priority project have been identified for Spain PP Highspeed railway axis of southwest Europe and PP Highspeed rail interoperability on the Iberian Peninsula Nevertheless the Iberian gauge wa is and will continue to be a basic problem for train crossing from the French border to the Iberian one through Portbou in the Pyrenees which result in poor rail transport performance and excessive use of road transportation truck cross the Pyrenees daily This go against the Commissions specific objective with regard to improving the functioning of the internal market environmental aspect and the aim of reducing carbon dioxide emission and of the railway infrastructure and Mediterranean corridor particularly a regard freight transport In it White Paper entitled European Transport Policy for the Commission highlighted it proposal the interoperability measure featured in Directives EC EC and EC Furthermore with a view to the publication next year of the Commissions White Paper on the Future of Transport Johann Friedrich Colsman a member of Antonio Tajanis Cabinet stated at the nd European Logistics Summit conference organised in Brussels on November that in the White Paper on the future of transport the Commission will have to attach great attention to intermodality open border for freight train among Member States and reinforce the identified corridor Given that the issue of the Iberian gauge is a basic problem that hinders the development and achievement of the priority project identified by the Commission and in particular the Mediterranean freight corridor what specific measure doe the Commission intend to take and what pressure will it exert on the Spanish Government in order to adapt the gauge to the European model,-0.15517344,-0.15517344

397,For about a year the Italian poultry sector has been hit by avian influenza which has brought about a huge and continuing economic crisis and slump in production. The industry consisting not only of the breeding sector but also of its offshoots which employ thousands of people and provide a living for their families has been brought to its knees because production processing and marketing in the entire sector have ground to a halt. The only available remedy is that  for direct damage i.e. for each fowl slaughtered and for the eggs that have to be destroyed. The entire industry is being damaged by the standstill in production with no hope of aid as it has always received little in the way of public subsidies from government institutions. The H 7 virus has existed in Italy for approximately a year and it will certainly not be prevented from spreading throughout Europe by destroying the entire poultry sector which has always guaranteed safety and quality in its production of poultrymeat and eggs. Moreover the halt in production means that distribution contracts are being lost and it is liable to create uncertainty for the future of the entire industry. Given the above can the Commission amend Directive 92/401 of 19 May 1992 in order to establish a fundamental targeted controlled and effective vaccination campaign so that breeding may resume and that such serious problems may be avoided in the future Can the European Union take appropriate action also in the form of funding to tackle this emergency which is affecting the entire poultry sector in Italy gearing the action not only towards the repair of the direct damage but also providing instruments to enable the whole industry to  productive  once again,P-0643/00,0,For about a year the Italian poultry sector ha been hit by avian influenza which ha brought about a huge and continuing economic crisis and slump in production The industry consisting not only of the breeding sector but also of it offshoot which employ thousand of people and provide a living for their family ha been brought to it knee because production processing and marketing in the entire sector have ground to a halt The only available remedy is that for direct damage ie for each fowl slaughtered and for the egg that have to be destroyed The entire industry is being damaged by the standstill in production with no hope of aid a it ha always received little in the way of public subsidy from government institution The H virus ha existed in Italy for approximately a year and it will certainly not be prevented from spreading throughout Europe by destroying the entire poultry sector which ha always guaranteed safety and quality in it production of poultrymeat and egg Moreover the halt in production mean that distribution contract are being lost and it is liable to create uncertainty for the future of the entire industry Given the above can the Commission amend Directive of May in order to establish a fundamental targeted controlled and effective vaccination campaign so that breeding may resume and that such serious problem may be avoided in the future Can the European Union take appropriate action also in the form of funding to tackle this emergency which is affecting the entire poultry sector in Italy gearing the action not only towards the repair of the direct damage but also providing instrument to enable the whole industry to productive once again,-0.27404496,-0.27404496

404,As the Commission will know there can occasionally be quite serious problems as regards traffic at the border between the European Union and Russia. As a Member of the European Parliament from Finland I often hear of problems afflicting the border crossing between Imatra and Svetogorsk. The cause of the problems is often attributed to the contradictory and inconsistent nature of the actions of Russian border officials. Operations carried out by officials on the Russian side of the border have not yet been developed in such a way as to ensure that they are professional impartial in accordance with the rules and reliable. EU citizens who frequently cross the border generally consider the operations on the Russian side of the border to be unpredictable as it is difficult to keep track of rapidly changing regulations. While the border between Finland and Russia is a border between two independent states it is also the external border of the European Union and this is therefore an issue which concerns the EU and Russia.

434,A new declaration was to be added to Protocol 30 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Protocol 30 grants the United Kingdom and Poland exemptions from the Charter of Fundamental Rights. An agreement was reached at the 2009 summit with the Czech Republic adding its name to the protocol at the last minute. The President of the Czech Republic was concerned in particular by the social rights contained in the Charter which are referred to in the Treaty of Lisbon thus making them legally binding. The official reason for the request was the fear that the Charter would enable the opening of the Bene Decrees. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament however halted ratification of the Czech exemption. The Committee published a report which refers to the Polish and British protocols as regrettable legal instruments that bring legal uncertainty and political confusion to European primary law. Because the European Parliament must give its opinion on any revision of the Treaty the Council cannot yet subject the Czech declaration to a legal analysis. The report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed that the Council refuse consent so that a Convention would not have to be convened on the issue which is the standard procedure in the case of a possible change to the European Treaties.

439,The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980 known as the Hague Convention seeks to guarantee the immediate return of children unlawfully removed or retained by one of their parents in a contracting State. It also seeks to ensure that the custody visitation and  rights of children in contracting States are respected. Under Article 3 the removal abroad of a child by a parent is considered unlawful when it takes place in violation of the custody rights granted to the other parent or to any institution or body under the laws of the State in which the child normally resided before being removed. Furthermore the Hague Convention lays down a simple and swift procedure for resolving the removal of minors outside their country of usual residence without exhaustive examination of the dispute between the parents. Rulings on the custody of such children can only be issued by a judge in the childs usual place of residence. Moreover a best practice guide has been drawn up by the Hague Permanent Office responsible for monitoring implementation of the convention to avoid disparities in the scope and level of services offered by the various central authorities entrusted with the task of enforcing the convention. Nevertheless the legal systems in numerous States which have signed the Hague Convention in particular the Brazilian legal authorities continue to consider these cases as child custody disputes in flagrant contravention of the letter and spirit of the convention thereby significantly delaying the implementation of its provisions and the resolution of disputes. It should be borne in mind that these displaced children are the main victims in such situations. Their prolonged removal has serious psychological repercussions which may dramatically affect their future lives. There are many unresolved cases involving European children who have been taken to third countries which are signatories to the convention particularly Brazil and whose return is being obstructed by poor application of the Convention.

451,The toxicity of pesticides is at the heart of the discussions on whether they should be permitted or prohibited. However the study of the macroeconomic costs related to the use of plant protection products has virtually not been mentioned at all. The environmental costs concern for example the reduction in pollination in addition to the health costs relating to health expenditure or to the reduced productivity of workers in contact with pesticides. There are also legal costs because the regulation and control of these substances and the decontamination of pesticide-polluted areas have a price. Lastly so-called avoidance costs are incurred when households prefer to spend more with the sole aim of avoiding pesticides for example by buying organic products. Some studies claim that these aggregate costs amount to several billion euro. 1.

460,The Commissions budget spokesperson Patrizio Fiorilli warned on 3 October 2012 that funding for the Erasmus programme was under threat. This has caused alarm among students and members of the  in many Member States who are already feeling the effects of major education budget cuts. The Erasmus programme is one of the initiatives to have brought greatest benefit to the  of the Member States since the founding of the European Union. Thousands of students have had the opportunity to study in other countries thereby improving their academic training and knowledge of foreign languages whilst also enabling them to form networks that extend beyond Member State borders. Cuts to Spains state education spending the result of the national budget have had a dramatic impact on Spanish students. The Spanish Governments spending cuts have resulted in tuition fee rises tougher restrictions on obtaining grants and many students getting increasingly into debt to finance their studies to name just a few examples. These cuts therefore represent an unprecedented attack on the universal right to education. The threat to funding for the Erasmus programme further increases the burden of the severe budget cuts that Spanish students are already suffering from. In the light of the budget cuts made by the Spanish Government and most of the Autonomous Communities slashing the EU budget would not only heighten the reverse progress on education currently being witnessed in Spain but would also mean that many advance payments made by various education authorities for the Erasmus programme could not be reimbursed. Bearing in mind the severe impact of the Spanish Governments education budget cuts and the fact that Spain is the country that hosts and sends the most Erasmus students does the Commission believe Spain is in a position to fulfil the Erasmus programmes objectives for the next few years Does the Commission plan to implement measures guaranteeing access to the Erasmus programme and payment of grants pledged to education authorities and students  ES C 301 E 17/10/2013,E-009366-12,0,The Commissions budget spokesperson Patrizio Fiorilli warned on October that funding for the Erasmus programme wa under threat This ha caused alarm among student and member of the in many Member States who are already feeling the effect of major education budget cut The Erasmus programme is one of the initiative to have brought greatest benefit to the of the Member States since the founding of the European Union Thousands of student have had the opportunity to study in other country thereby improving their academic training and knowledge of foreign language whilst also enabling them to form network that extend beyond Member State border Cuts to Spains state education spending the result of the national budget have had a dramatic impact on Spanish student The Spanish Governments spending cut have resulted in tuition fee rise tougher restriction on obtaining grant and many student getting increasingly into debt to finance their study to name just a few example These cut therefore represent an unprecedented attack on the universal right to education The threat to funding for the Erasmus programme further increase the burden of the severe budget cut that Spanish student are already suffering from In the light of the budget cut made by the Spanish Government and most of the Autonomous Communities slashing the EU budget would not only heighten the reverse progress on education currently being witnessed in Spain but would also mean that many advance payment made by various education authority for the Erasmus programme could not be reimbursed Bearing in mind the severe impact of the Spanish Governments education budget cut and the fact that Spain is the country that host and sends the most Erasmus student doe the Commission believe Spain is in a position to fulfil the Erasmus programme objective for the next few year Does the Commission plan to implement measure guaranteeing access to the Erasmus programme and payment of grant pledged to education authority and student ES C E,-0.47854894,-0.47854894

467,In recent weeks millions of people across Europe have taken to the streets to condemn cuts in social spending and the austerity measures pursued by several Member State governments including Greece Spain and Portugal following prompting and pressure from EU institutions. When members of the public were exercising their democratic right to demonstrate in Athens on Wednesday 30 June 2011 and in Barcelona less than a month ago  authorities responded with violence repression and police brutality. Many EU citizens were injured or arrested as a direct result. Protestors in Barcelona bore the brunt of a brutal police charge even though they had been acting peacefully and had not resorted to violence at any point during their democratic protest against the curtailment of their social political and economic rights.

In order to prevent food waste it would be possible to abolish best before labels on products with a very long shelf life. As long ago as 2012 the European Parliament called on the Commission in a resolution to clarify the meaning of the two labels and investigate other forms of labelling1. In 2014 various Member States called for amendments to the annexes to Regulation EU No 1169/2011 in order to amplify the list of products with very long shelf lives2.

This approach is inadmissible because it fails to take into account many factors. In particular1 a extraction estimates for the mine are for 18 579 705 cubic metres 3 500 000 cubic metres of which will be deposited on two slag heaps.

Neither is any reference made to the changes to or the disappearance of various streams or of a large area of juvenile oak trees resulting from a series of forest fires in the Orallo mountains d the environmental impact survey was carried out in isolation as if this were the only mine in the area without taking into account the proximity of other mines including FeixolÊ_n certain cuttings that have already been mined out others which are currently being exploited cuttings that are in the process of being authorised and several others at the study stage.

The Community Decision of 2004  the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography which lists forms of conduct constituting an offence linked to child pornography may have produced some results but it has not managed to curb the phenomenon.

500,In 2000 the EKAB air rescue fleet was set up with 75  of the funding being provided under the second Community Support Framework. Following a series of accidents the Greek Government decided to transfer the fleet to the airforce and reregister it accordingly with the Air Transport Utilities Command DAYKO for which the airforce will assume responsibility by 20 May 2003. However the unit has not yet been legally formalised. This is causing serious concern given that the strict JAA Joint Aviation Authority standards do not apply to the armed forces and that the accident involving the EKAB helicopter was largely caused by inadequate safety specifications. 1. Is the transfer to the armed forces of helicopter crews who under the second CSF were considered to be civilian emergency rescue personnel thereby increasing the Community budget for the armed forces in accordance with the principles governing CSF funding 2. Does the Commission accept some of the responsibility for the fact that following its transfer to the armed forces the European Union-funded EKAB helicopter fleet will no longer be governed by the stringent JAA safety rules and in particular JAR Code 145 on technical backup for aircraft and JAR OPS-1 and JAR OPS-3 which lay down stringent standards regarding aircraft and helicopters their equipment the safety and flight experience of air crews and JAA licensing since it is specifically stated that these rules are binding on emergency air ambulance services but not on flights by aircraft belonging to the armed forces 3.

504,Nowadays relations between the EU and ACP countries are regulated by the partnership agreements signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000. Economic agreements have been implemented over the years and drawn up with other ACP States with the aim of removing progressively barriers to trade between them and enhancing cooperation in all areas relevant to trade1.

506,The Advocate-General of the Court of Justice of the European Communities has published his opinion on the case of Outokumpu Oy versus the State of Finland. Outokumpu Oy was seeking a refund from the State of Finland of the tax levied on the electricity it had imported from Sweden which it regarded as a form of import duty prohibited by Community law. The Advocate-Generals opinion does not support Outokumpu Oys claim. The Commission had informed Finland on 23 November 1995 that it regarded the electricity tax which was then in force in Finland as discrimination contrary to Article 95 of the Treaty. Largely on this basis the bias in favour of the environment was abandoned in the taxation of electricity in Finland with effect from 1 January 1997. According to the Advocate-General the Treaty does not prohibit taxation of electricity which favours less environmentally damaging production methods. Similarly the Directive on the transmission of electricity stipulates that energy policy should not have the sole object of reducing costs and  but that account should also be taken of  of energy with the environment. If the Court decides to uphold the opinion of the Advocate-General will the Commission even then consider that the electricity tax levied in Finland before 1997 was contrary to the Treaty or would Finland have had the right to retain its taxation system which served to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in electricity production,P-0042/98,0,The AdvocateGeneral of the Court of Justice of the European Communities ha published his opinion on the case of Outokumpu Oy versus the State of Finland Outokumpu Oy wa seeking a refund from the State of Finland of the tax levied on the electricity it had imported from Sweden which it regarded a a form of import duty prohibited by Community law The AdvocateGenerals opinion doe not support Outokumpu Oys claim The Commission had informed Finland on November that it regarded the electricity tax which wa then in force in Finland a discrimination contrary to Article of the Treaty Largely on this basis the bias in favour of the environment wa abandoned in the taxation of electricity in Finland with effect from January According to the AdvocateGeneral the Treaty doe not prohibit taxation of electricity which favour le environmentally damaging production method Similarly the Directive on the transmission of electricity stipulates that energy policy should not have the sole object of reducing cost and but that account should also be taken of of energy with the environment If the Court decides to uphold the opinion of the AdvocateGeneral will the Commission even then consider that the electricity tax levied in Finland before wa contrary to the Treaty or would Finland have had the right to retain it taxation system which served to reduce emission of carbon dioxide in electricity production,-0.108185254,-0.108185254

Agents for the firm have told would-be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot. The agents say some of  products have been exported to the UK and most likely to other EU states and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is traditional and nothing to make such a big fuss about. Doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing numbers seeking to improve their looks. Apart from the ethical concerns there is also the potential risk of infection. In the light of these shocking revelations what plans does the Council have to bring forward regulations to control cosmetic treatments such as collagen and to put a stop to this outrageous trade,H-0723/05,0,On Tuesday September the Guardian newspaper reported that a Chinese is using skin harvested from the corps of executed convict to develop beauty product for sale in Europe Agents for the firm have told wouldbe customer it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatment from skin taken from prisoner after they have been shot The agent say some of product have been exported to the UK and most likely to other EU state and that the use of skin from condemned convict is traditional and nothing to make such a big fuss about Doctors and politician say the discovery highlight the danger faced by the increasing number seeking to improve their look Apart from the ethical concern there is also the potential risk of infection In the light of these shocking revelation what plan doe the Council have to bring forward regulation to control cosmetic treatment such a collagen and to put a stop to this outrageous trade,-0.0965054,-0.0965054

540,The EU Member States have high standards of food safety however European food producers and consumers are concerned that the conclusion of negotiations between the EU and the USA could lead to lowerquality and less safe food ending up on European tables. This is leading the public to speculate that products which would be unable to meet current EU safety standards could be given access to the EUs market through the processes of equivalence or mutual recognition. The following are examples of divergences between EU and US rules 1. The US meat industry uses antibacterial chemicals such as chlorine to eliminate E. coli and other bacteria in poultry processing. The EU meanwhile only permits the use of water and steam during slaughter. 2. The US meat industry uses ractopamine hydrochloride in feeds for cows pigs and poultry as a growth accelerant for increasing muscle mass. Ractopamine is banned in 160 countries worldwide including the EU Russia and China for being harmful to human and animal health. 3. The maximum permitted levels of pesticides in fruit and vegetables are lower in the EU than in the USA. Pesticides have been proven on many occasions to be harmful to human health and raising permitted levels through TTIP would have an adverse effect on public health in Europe.

578,In 2010 the Oslo Convention on  banning of cluster munitions as signed by 111 states including most EU Member States and the NATO states took effect. The agreement requires its signatories to ban the deployment development manufacture storage import and export of cluster munitions and to destroy existing stocks. The Convention on Cluster Munitions is intended to curtail injuries of civilians who account for 98  of victims. Today it is believed that 69 countries continue to keep stocks of these weapons. Only 12 states have apparently destroyed part of their stocks. According to estimates there are approximately 610200 cluster munitions in existence around the world. The US regards cluster munitions as legitimate weapons and opposes the international ban on them. Cluster munitions are particularly insidious. Explosive devices launched from aircraft divide into hundreds of small bombs in the air which spread over large areas and contaminate them even after the end of a conflict due to the large number of unexploded devices. Cluster bombs that remain in the earth explode at the slightest touch whether by a child playing nearby or a farmer working the land. 1.

603,After receiving authorisation from the Danish authorities for a regular bus service in accordance with Regulation EEC No 684/921 of 16 March 1992 as amended by Regulation EC No 11/982 a Danish  has independently started up a regular bus service at its own expense on a route between the centre of Copenhagen Denmark and the airport at MalmÊ_/Sturup Sweden. MalmÊ_/Sturup airport caters for a number of charter and low-cost airlines including Ryanair as well as Swedish domestic flights. The charges at Sturup airport are much lower than at Copenhagen airport Kastrup and an increasing number of Danish air travellers are therefore opting for Sturup airport as their point of departure. These Danish passengers are using the newly established bus route No 737 from the centre of Copenhagen to the airport in Sweden. An essential operational requirement for a regular bus service is the provision of permanent bus stops with signs and timetable information to enable passengers to locate the point from which the bus leaves. However the local authority has refused to allow the airport bus to Sweden a central and reasonably attractive bus stop in Copenhagen.

In France the government is preparing to introduce a new sex education course aimed at replacing mental categories such as sex with the concept of gender to demonstrate that the differences between men and women are not caused by nature but are produced and reproduced as a result of social conditions. In Italy a proposal has been made to remove the names father and mother from nursery and school registration forms and to replace them with parent 1 and parent 2 instead. According to the results of the research carried out in 2009 by the Eurydice executive agency on Gender Differences in Educational  Study on the Measures Taken and the Current Situation in Europe teachers perceptions of male and femaleness are crucial for their relations with pupils and can be an important factor in generating gender equity in schools. In the Council Conclusions on investing in education and training  a response to Rethinking Education Investing in skills for better socioeconomic  and the 2013 Annual Growth Survey the Council recognises the central role assigned to education and training as a key driver for growth  and for preventing unemployment. While each Member State is responsible for the organisation and content of its education and training systems European cooperation together with recourse to EU programmes can contribute to the development of quality education and training by supporting and supplementing national measures and helping Member States to  challenges.

640,Toy safety studies consistently reveal major defects in products which thus pose a risk to their users. This was also the case with the latest investigation conducted by the German Stiftung Warentest organisation Issue 11/11 in which 40 toys were tested for substances with a harmful effect on human health. Many of the toys contained very high levels of nickel which causes allergenic reactions and  were found for example in the paint on the handle of a toy suitcase as well as nonylphenol ethoxylates in the paint of the case itself. The limit values in the Toys Directive that can be applied to substances such as nonylphenol are however very high and do not take into account the hormone-active effect of this substance. Under Article 461a andb in conjunction with Article 47 of Directive 2009/48/EC the Commission can amend points 11 fragrances and 13 migration limits of Part III chemical properties of Annex II and adapt these to technical and scientific developments.

670,At European level Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 2013 governs the quality of water intended for human consumption. The directive seeks to protect human health by setting requirements for cleanliness and purity which the drinking water of the European Union must meet in line with the World Health Organisations guidelines. In Italy Legislative Decree 31 of 2 February 2001 sets a maximum concentration for boron of 1 mg/l. Directive 2003/40/CE of 16 May 2003 establishing the concentration limits for chemical constituents of natural mineral waters sets no limit for boron pending a future opinion of EFSA which has apparently not yet been given.

671,The ambitious aims of the Lisbon strategy are  increasingly unattainable.  from China agreements with developing countries and reforms with devastating consequences are putting a severe strain on the economies of some of the EU Member States which depend heavily on farming and have a large number of SMEs. If it is not changed the reform of the CMO in sugar will destroy sugar-beet production in 10 EU Member States including Spain Portugal Italy and Poland to the benefit of partners in central northern Europe with disastrous consequences for the industry and damaging effects on the whole structure of society. Europe has imposed standards on all manufacturing processes safety environmental protection health rules waste disposal etc. which have an enormous effect on retail prices. And yet it allows onto the EU market very cheap products with no health certification or EC conformity produced by a workforce which is paid starvation wages. The sustainable agricultural model for Europe as defined by the Commission at least for the CMO in sugar will have no positive effects and will not lead to sustainable economic growth with new improved employment opportunities or greater social cohesion as aspired to by the Lisbon Strategy. In Italy alone the entry into force of the reform will mean closure of 19 sugar refineries with 7000 permanent or seasonal employees and loss of employment for 52000 agricultural employees and 18000 processing workers with incalculable economic and social consequences. Can the Commission say  what measures are planned to prevent the dismantling of the industry and cushion the socio-economic impact of this reform  whether a restrictive reform such as this which runs counter to the principle of multifunctionality introduced by the new CAP is not in conflict with EU citizens freedom to exercise an economic activity and right to work  whether it does not take the view that given the inevitable reduction in European quotas it should co-finance a reconstruction programme for the industry and allow the Member States to grant national aid,E-2305/05,0,The ambitious aim of the Lisbon strategy are increasingly unattainable from China agreement with developing country and reform with devastating consequence are putting a severe strain on the economy of some of the EU Member States which depend heavily on farming and have a large number of SMEs If it is not changed the reform of the CMO in sugar will destroy sugarbeet production in EU Member States including Spain Portugal Italy and Poland to the benefit of partner in central northern Europe with disastrous consequence for the industry and damaging effect on the whole structure of society Europe ha imposed standard on all manufacturing process safety environmental protection health rule waste disposal etc which have an enormous effect on retail price And yet it allows onto the EU market very cheap product with no health certification or EC conformity produced by a workforce which is paid starvation wage The sustainable agricultural model for Europe a defined by the Commission at least for the CMO in sugar will have no positive effect and will not lead to sustainable economic growth with new improved employment opportunity or greater social cohesion a aspired to by the Lisbon Strategy In Italy alone the entry into force of the reform will mean closure of sugar refinery with permanent or seasonal employee and loss of employment for agricultural employee and processing worker with incalculable economic and social consequence Can the Commission say what measure are planned to prevent the dismantling of the industry and cushion the socioeconomic impact of this reform whether a restrictive reform such a this which run counter to the principle of multifunctionality introduced by the new CAP is not in conflict with EU citizen freedom to exercise an economic activity and right to work whether it doe not take the view that given the inevitable reduction in European quota it should cofinance a reconstruction programme for the industry and allow the Member States to grant national aid,-0.40758395,-0.40758395

The Greek press for example the Ethnos of 30 December 2006 is accusing the Greek Government of Trojan horse tactics in other words making use of New Democracy sympathisers within the ADEP an independent authority to force a decision by it ensuring jobs for the boys in the public sector generally. Recently a select meeting of the ASEP gave the green light to the DEI to publish a notice  for the recruitment of 2035 members of staff effectively legalising the infringement of all objective recruitment criteria according to the press. The DEI requested and obtained ASEP authorisation to modify the coefficients for the assessment of candidates at the interview stage. The new coefficients introduced by the  are no longer situated between 0.80 and 1.20 in accordance with statutory requirements but between 0 and 1. This means in practice that if a candidate obtains 1 000 points based on objective criteria degree post-graduate degree doctorate knowledge of foreign languages etc. this score is effectively cancelled out if he obtains zero at the interview stage 0 x 1000  0. Under the new arrangements only 24 months of professional experience is taken into account instead of 60 as is the case for recruitment to all other bodies. This effectively favours those who signed contracts while the present ND government was in power.

720,On 23 May 2008 the Italian Government issued a legislative decree concerning extraordinary measures  the waste disposal emergency in the Campania region. Article 92 of the decree states that the facilities referred to in Article 91 thereof are authorised for use in the disposal of waste labelled with the EWC codes 19.12.12 19.05.01 19.05.03 20.03.01 19.01.12 19.01.14 and 19.02.06. Those facilities are also authorised for use in the disposal of waste labelled with the EWC codes 19.01.11 19.01.13 19.02.05 and 19.12.11 solely in the case of total hydrocarbons originating from urban waste sorting and treatment plants by analogy with the derogations laid down in Article 17 of the decree. This means that urban waste tips can be used to dispose of refuse with the EWC codes 19.01.11 19.01.12 and 19.02.05 which is classified as hazardous waste. It is therefore possible in contravention of the legislation in force in Italy and the rest of Europe for facilities equipped to handle non-hazardous waste to store sludge containing hazardous substances bottom ash and slag full of hazardous substances as well as fly ash also containing hazardous substances. The decree also provides for the incineration at the Acerra waste-to-energy plant and the four other such plants to be built in that region of the 78 million waste bales stored in Campania. According to the Naples Public Prosecutors Office certification has been granted for the mandatory treatment applicable to refuse in the first phase of the waste disposal process  i.e. the separation of wet and dry waste and all the other processes aimed at waste stabilisation  when this has not been carried out. This means that tonnes of polluting rubbish have ended up in tips producing leachates and the whole of the Campania region is said to be full of polluting waste bales that are a danger to health.

These impressive figures indicate the extensive use made of them by people carrying out financial transactions in connection with unlawful trafficking in goods and laundering the proceeds thereof since cash transfers make it easier to evade anti-laundering controls and disguise the provenance of funds. In 2010 4 million counterfeit products were confiscated charges were laid against 186 people 73 people were arrested and assets to the value of EUR 182 million were frozen. In the seven years from 2003 to 2010 the total number of seizures rose from 34 million to over 110 million. The criminal networks involved are transnational and 64 of the counterfeit products seized are Chinese. 42 websites were also suspended and access to one Swedish website was blocked. The value of the goods impounded between 2008 and 2009 exceeded EUR 2 billion or around EUR 40 000 per operation. Every day the financial police withdraw goods worth EUR 3 million from the market The number of money transfers made and counterfeit goods confiscated is constantly increasing despite the fact that the financial police has stepped up its activities in both fields. This being so 1. How does the Commission explain this apparent paradox 2. Does the Commission consider that it could be due to the limited extent of legislation covering money transfers and counterfeit goods and the fact that people who break the law are not subject to sufficiently severe penalties 3.

738,On 11 January 2011 the Associated Press reported that 70 Iranian Christians from the house church movement which is a  of Iranians who gather in private residences for prayer and Bible readings were arrested in a post-Christmas crackdown. The wave of arrests began on Christmas morning and opposition websites reported that 70 Christians had been arrested. Many were later released but reports suggest that more than a dozen remain in detention. It is still unclear what charges could be brought against the jailed Christians but allegations of trying to convert Muslims could carry a death sentence. The authorities view them with suspicion on grounds ranging from trying to convert Muslims to being possible footholds for foreign influence or a potential breeding ground for political opposition. Morteza Tamadon the Governor of Tehran described the Christians as hard-line missionaries who have inserted themselves into Islam like a parasite according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Also the manager of the Iranian Christian News Agency Saman Kamvar attributes the raids against Christians  made by the countrys Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in December in which he denounced the growth of private house churches.

744,The organisation of social security is a responsibility of the Member States. The European Union is responsible for coordination among the various national systems and can if necessary facilitate and promote national reforms by means of the open method of coordination using exchanges of best practices. In various Member States the subfields of social  several pillars. We may take as an example their pension systems. In addition to statutory pension schemes the first pillar in many Member States a role is also assigned to employers contributions the second pillar and individual pension savings the third pillar but in reality the dividing lines between the various pillars are  increasingly blurred. Particularly at times of budgetary austerity we have observed shifts among the various pillars. In other fields in which social security plays a role too  such as healthcare care of older persons unemployment insurance and in some cases also accident insurance including occupational accident insurance  there is a trend towards a multi-pillar system. The security afforded by the public sector is often supplemented with additional provision including additional financing by employers and the individual in order to ensure adequate protection. In its Green Paper on the future of pensions the Commission advocated an integrated holistic approach to the pension problem. Only with such an approach can policy-makers at European and national level take the right policy decisions in an informed manner. 1.

748,Since 2007 15 October has been the International Day of Rural Women in recognition of the vital contribution that women in rural areas make in enhancing agricultural and rural development improving food security and eradicating rural poverty. The women concerned play a pivotal role in the modernisation and development of rural areas. They account for over 20 of the worlds population and do around 80 of family farm work. In Spain alone around six million women and their families live in rural areas. Shared ownership of farms is one of the factors that enables women in rural areas to participate in the running of those farms on an equal footing and make social security contributions thereby qualifying for the relevant benefits. This also  depopulation which is one of the threats to the survival of our rural villages.

749,In connection with the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area SEPA from 1 January 2008 debit card payments in Belgium were to take place through a new payment scheme called Maestro. From that date Maestro was to charge an interchange fee to small traders. However the Commission has expressed doubts about the interchange fee. Commissioner Kroes has said that the introduction of SEPA must not lead the banking industry to raise prices or lower service quality. The success of SEPA in Belgium and other countries where electronic payment had  widely accepted and thus relatively cheap depended on a decision on the interchange fee. The higher its cost for traders the less attractive it became for them and for the consumer. In the mean time in May 2007 the Belgian banking sector suspended its decision on replacing the relatively cheap and efficient Bancontact/Mister Cash payment scheme with Maestro. Since then all those affected have been awaiting a decision from the Commission. On 15 November 2007 however the Commission deferred its decision on abolishing the interchange fee system. I should therefore like to ask the Commission why it has deferred its decision on the interchange fee. When does the Commission feel it will be able to clarify the picture on this matter which is so vital to consumers In doing so will it take account of the fact that SEPA has to be introduced in such a way that it encourages electronic payment rather than putting a brake on it,P-6492/07,0,In connection with the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area SEPA from January debit card payment in Belgium were to take place through a new payment scheme called Maestro From that date Maestro wa to charge an interchange fee to small trader However the Commission ha expressed doubt about the interchange fee Commissioner Kroes ha said that the introduction of SEPA must not lead the banking industry to raise price or lower service quality The success of SEPA in Belgium and other country where electronic payment had widely accepted and thus relatively cheap depended on a decision on the interchange fee The higher it cost for trader the le attractive it became for them and for the consumer In the mean time in May the Belgian banking sector suspended it decision on replacing the relatively cheap and efficient BancontactMister Cash payment scheme with Maestro Since then all those affected have been awaiting a decision from the Commission On November however the Commission deferred it decision on abolishing the interchange fee system I should therefore like to ask the Commission why it ha deferred it decision on the interchange fee When doe the Commission feel it will be able to clarify the picture on this matter which is so vital to consumer In doing so will it take account of the fact that SEPA ha to be introduced in such a way that it encourages electronic payment rather than putting a brake on it,-0.4466074,-0.4466074

751,The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe has reportedly assumed life-threatening proportions. The police have arrested more than 1 300 shop keepers and managers who refused to halve the price of their products as President Mugabes government had instructed. Halving prices has led to panic buying at large chains of stores. Essentials such as sugar cooking oil and bread are now obtainable only on the black market. Petrol stations are dry. According to eye witnesses many shops have been looted by government party supporters. Inflation - the highest in the world - is the result of the never-ending printing of money with which the Government pays civil servants police officers and soldiers. According to the opposition party MDC the Government is attempting nine months ahead of the presidential elections to secure the votes of the poor.

754,According to pressure groups and researchers from the Aalborg University Acoustics Research Department cogeneration plants with inadequate sound insulation and vibration absorption cause noise pollution since the low-frequency wavelength means that the sound can travel very long distances  in the case of cogeneration plants as much as 30 km. Low-frequency noise is sound at a frequency that only a certain percentage of people can hear. The organisation which drew our attention to this matter refers to a study carried out at the Technical University of Denmark DTU showing that 3-5  of the population perceive low-frequency noise up to 5 times more powerfully than others. Since the total population of the EU is some 500 million this means that between 15 and 20 million EU citizens have this hearing condition. In Denmark the medical profession has not been informed about this study and so many people who have this hearing condition have been misdiagnosed as having tinnitus. The situation is likely to be the same in other EU countries. The organisation in question has unsuccessfully lobbied the Danish Environment Ministry to have the noise limit reduced by 10 db. At present the limit for low-frequency noise is 20 db indoors at night in residential buildings a little more in daytime and again a little more in non-residential buildings. One other problem has been that it is difficult to measure low-frequency noise accurately and thus detect its presence. People living near a cogeneration plant which is not properly sound-insulated or a wind turbine are disturbed by the noise 24 hours a day described as a deep rumbling noise from outside or a lorry engine idling which prevents them from sleeping in their own houses. No earplugs can keep the noise out. The term low-frequency noise should not be confused with the related term infra-sound. What does the Commission propose to do about this widespread problem Could the solution be to introduce a minimum harmonised level for low-frequency noise,P-4845/09,0,According to pressure group and researcher from the Aalborg University Acoustics Research Department cogeneration plant with inadequate sound insulation and vibration absorption cause noise pollution since the lowfrequency wavelength mean that the sound can travel very long distance in the case of cogeneration plant a much a km Lowfrequency noise is sound at a frequency that only a certain percentage of people can hear The organisation which drew our attention to this matter refers to a study carried out at the Technical University of Denmark DTU showing that of the population perceive lowfrequency noise up to time more powerfully than others Since the total population of the EU is some million this mean that between and million EU citizen have this hearing condition In Denmark the medical profession ha not been informed about this study and so many people who have this hearing condition have been misdiagnosed a having tinnitus The situation is likely to be the same in other EU country The organisation in question ha unsuccessfully lobbied the Danish Environment Ministry to have the noise limit reduced by db At present the limit for lowfrequency noise is db indoors at night in residential building a little more in daytime and again a little more in nonresidential building One other problem ha been that it is difficult to measure lowfrequency noise accurately and thus detect it presence People living near a cogeneration plant which is not properly soundinsulated or a wind turbine are disturbed by the noise hour a day described a a deep rumbling noise from outside or a lorry engine idling which prevents them from sleeping in their own house No earplug can keep the noise out The term lowfrequency noise should not be confused with the related term infrasound What doe the Commission propose to do about this widespread problem Could the solution be to introduce a minimum harmonised level for lowfrequency noise,-0.073770165,-0.073770165

756,This Member submitted question for written answer E2377/2010 to the Commission. Commissioner Poto_niks answer included the following On 9 April 2010 the Maltese Government adopted legislation permitting spring hunting of some 7 500 birds in Malta for one week at the end of April 2010. The legislation imposes a number of restrictions in relation to spring hunting and provides detailed measures for controlling spring hunting. The Commission considers that in principle the new legislation permitting spring hunting in 2010 appears  with the requirements of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It is nevertheless essential to effectively enforce all the conditions set out in the new legislation duration of the hunting season the number of hunting licences and the number of birds to be hunted. This will be monitored by the Commission. The BBC recently reported that thousands of protected birds such as bee-eaters harriers and cuckoos are still being illegally killed during the hunting season as they migrate from Malta in the Mediterranean to mainland Europe.

757,In response to breaches of the provisions of Regulation No 998/20031 on the transport of animals by disreputable animal protection agencies who had engaged in an illicit trade in dogs the Commission has enacted a new regulation Regulation EU No 388/20102 which entered into force on 27 May 2010. Under the regulation people transporting more than five dogs will be required to show more than just pet passports with proof of valid anti-rabies inoculation if they wish to take the animals across borders. In future health certificates will be needed in such cases3. The animals must undergo a veterinary examination less than 24 hours before departure to ensure that their identification is valid that they have had all necessary vaccinations and that they are fit to travel. The veterinary authorities in the country of destination are then notified electronically using Traces. Sled dog races are generally held in regions where snowfall is guaranteed making international travel with dogs unavoidable. Owing to uncertain weather conditions and snowfall the decision to take part in an event is often taken only shortly before a weekend. However on a Friday it is no easy task to find a veterinary officer with the time to examine 10 or 20 dogs.

794,On 20 March 2006 by decision of the Turkish Directorate-General for Foundations the ownership of the orphanage on the island of Prinkipos was transferred from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to the Turkish Institute for Foundations. The Patriarchate legally possessed the orphanage under a title deed granted by the Republic of Turkey in 1929 which was renewed in 1992. In 1999 the Directorate-General for Foundations illegally declared it confiscated and after taking the case to the Turkish courts managed to have it transferred to the Turkish Institute for Foundations.

799,The Bonifacio Strait which separates Corsica from Sardinia is hazardous to shipping. France and Italy have prohibited vessels sailing under their flag and transporting hazardous or noxious products from passing through these straits since 1993. Nowadays therefore there is very little traffic in the Strait and its economic importance is negligible. But an accident involving a vessel which was neither French nor Italian but was sailing under another countrys flag and transporting hazardous goods could cause a disaster on the scale of the sinking of the Erika flying the Maltese flag or the Prestige sailing under the flag of the Bahamas. The Bonifacio Strait is classified as a strait used for international shipping and as such is subject to the right of free transit passage by merchant vessels. This means that a potentially dangerous situation continues to exist despite the absence of  economic arguments for maintaining it.

While measures have been taken to reduce the occurrence of denied boarding due to overbooking an EU study has shown that large numbers of passengers are still being denied boarding against their will within the EU. Many airlines use the no-show clause in their planning which uses an algorithm to decide how many extra tickets they should sell in the case of no-shows.

809,The city of Baelo Claudia located in what is now the municipality of Tarifa on the coast of Cadiz province Spain came into being at the end of the second century BC as a trading post with North Africa and an administrative centre. It flourished under the emperor Claudius 4154 AD. The ruins of Baelo Claudia still offer all the representative elements of a Roman city. Today the main attractions of the locality are the ruins and the spectacular landscape in which they are framed the Natural Protected Area of the Strait. This is one of the few parts of the Andalusian coast to have remained free from obsessive development and property speculation. The culture ministry of the regional government of Andalusia has begin to construct a centre for the archaeological research into the Baelo Claudia ruins to be located within the Natural Protected Area. This building has already been roundly criticised on the grounds of its shape and location by local cultural associations and ecological groups its visual impact is such that it would be difficult to integrate it into the protected area.

816,Under Article 48 of Legislative Decree 22/97 Italy has set up a syndicate with legal force to recycle polythene waste. Article 489 stipulates that waste of this type has to be handed over to the syndicate. The regulations governing Polieco the syndicate incorporated under the above article require producers of polythene raw materials and processors of polythene products to pay a contribution in proportion to the volume of goods released on to the market. From the outset however this legislation and Poliecos activities have given rise to serious doubts and great perplexity and most polythene producers have chosen to not to join the syndicate because the body of rules governing it is incoherent and difficult to enforce. Despite this fact the Italian Parliament has introduced a system of penalties both for failure to join the syndicate and for failure to pay the contributions adding to the totalitarian and monopolistic nature of the syndicate1. Recent Community legal practice in environmental matters2 clearly specifies that waste recycling syndicates cannot constitute a  must be allowed to choose from the different recycling systems and a fee cannot be charged when no service is provided in return. The fact that these principles do not appear to have been observed in the Italian legislation setting up the Polieco syndicate manifestly infringes the EC Treaty3. The Commission 1.

839,Ms Chara Kalomiri a Greek citizen is at the centre of a legal saga which raises disturbing doubts as to whether freedom of religion is being respected in Greece. She was reported by the Mount Athos authorities for having led from September 1994 to March 1995 a centre for practical psychological philosophy in the Chalkidiki peninsula. She was sentenced by a Greek lower court in 1997 this sentence was quashed by the Supreme Court but a retrial led to her being sentenced over again. The judges justified their verdict on the grounds that the place of Buddhist worship devoted to meditation had not received the mandatory authorisation of the Ministry for Education and Religion which is granted after the Orthodox hierarchy has given its opinion. Does the Council not consider that given that respect for religious freedom is a fundamental right of the individual and a  to all the Member States action should be taken under Articles 6 and 7 of the TEU or Article 13 of the EC Treaty as a matter of urgency to put an end to all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and all forms of discrimination related to religious freedom with particular attention being paid to Greece  IT C 89 E 20/03/2001  155,P-2161/00,0,Ms Chara Kalomiri a Greek citizen is at the centre of a legal saga which raise disturbing doubt a to whether freedom of religion is being respected in Greece She wa reported by the Mount Athos authority for having led from September to March a centre for practical psychological philosophy in the Chalkidiki peninsula She wa sentenced by a Greek lower court in this sentence wa quashed by the Supreme Court but a retrial led to her being sentenced over again The judge justified their verdict on the ground that the place of Buddhist worship devoted to meditation had not received the mandatory authorisation of the Ministry for Education and Religion which is granted after the Orthodox hierarchy ha given it opinion Does the Council not consider that given that respect for religious freedom is a fundamental right of the individual and a to all the Member States action should be taken under Articles and of the TEU or Article of the EC Treaty a a matter of urgency to put an end to all violation of human right and fundamental freedom and all form of discrimination related to religious freedom with particular attention being paid to Greece IT C E,-0.35336635,-0.35336635

Komorowski gave as his reason for this general amnesty that We want Poland to be an open hospitable and friendly country for those who are seeking a better life. However on 7 July 2008 the European Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs agreed that it would in future only be possible under certain conditions for EU Member States to proclaim a general amnesty for illegal immigrants remaining on their territory. This was prompted by a general amnesty granted to 800 000 illegal immigrants in Spain which other EU Member States predicted would act as a pull-factor.

Does the Commission agree that the general amnesty proclaimed in Poland is irresponsible since the legalised illegal immigrants will then be free to travel throughout the EU If not why not 2. Does the Commission expect that the general amnesty in Poland will put unwanted pressure on the other EU Member States and does it agree that they should be able to protect themselves against this pressure If not why not 3.

871,Ovos-moles sweet eggs are a traditional product of the Aveiro region. The European Union has already registered the PGI Protected Geographical Indication status of this product. Recently as a result of a partnership with Aveiro University a method of freezing has been developed that preserves all the products organoleptic qualities.

In the meantime an application has been submitted to the Commission to amend the Specification for Ovos-Moles de Aveiro PGI with a view to incorporating the deep-freezing process.

879,In January 2012 the Commission proposed a reform of Europes data protection regime to strengthen online privacy rights. The draft General Data Protection Regulation introduces many novelties such as the concept of joint and several liability of controllers and processors for damage suffered by data subjects Article 77.

909,The Italian minister responsible for institutional reform Mr Umberto Bossi has recently described the European Union as Stalinist and as a kind of Forcolandia a colourful pejorative term which suggests that the EU promotes acts which undermine the fundamental freedoms of the individual. Other government representatives share or at least endorse his deplorable views. Mr Silvio Berlusconi who is not only President of the Italian Council but also Italys temporary Foreign Minister attended the Lega Nord congress where Mr Bossi repeated his accusations and invective aimed at the entire European Community. Not only did Mr Berlusconi not react to those accusations he implicitly endorsed them through his silence and his smiling acquiescence. Such behaviour on the part of leading representatives of the Italian Government may cast doubt on Italys genuine desire to cooperate fairly in European integration.

915,On 15 June 2017 Augustin Breda an employee of Electrolux the Swedish multinational working at the Susegana plant in Treviso was dismissed over alleged fraud in connection with dependent family benefits provided for under Law 104/92. For many years he had as a Fiom/Cgil shop-floor representative played a key role in industrial disputes for example those arising in connection with the arduous nature of the work and the organisation thereof protesting on several occasions at the particularly demanding pace and heavy work cycles. Mr Bredas dismissal came after a private investigator specially hired for the purpose had submitted his findings even though he was able to provide evidence that he was caring for his 90-year-old invalid aunt. The result was a massive wildcat strike against the manifest victimisation of a shop steward bringing the plant to a halt.

927,In its report of July 2001 the European Parliament alerted the Commission  problems in the Czech Republics banking sector. The recent implementation by the Czech authorities of an unlimited guarantee granted to the CSOB bank in the context of its take-over last year of IPB is evidence that such problems are ongoing. We understand that the Commission is examining that specific case and the wider issue  and state aid in the financial services sector of the Czech Republic and other accession countries. While accepting that the Europe Agreement does not provide for satisfactory remedies in specific cases the Commission nevertheless has a powerful political tool available to it in the shape of the Enlargement report it is drafting on each of the candidate countries. Reference to existing problems in these reports backed up by case-specific examples would send a strong signal to the authorities in the candidate countries that they must address these issues more satisfactorily. Since I raised this issue with the Commission in the Foreign Affairs Committee of June 2001 I have been informed that the Czech authorities have taken no discernible steps to resolve the situation. Even more worryingly there are strong indications that  authorities in the Czech Republic are not dealing with the case in an independent manner and that proceedings by them to evaluate the state aid in this case are simply being ignored. The value of the Enlargement reports is that as well as accurately reporting and analysing the convergence of accession countries towards the acquis they provide an assessment of the readiness of accession countries to conform with the principles and philosophy of the EU.

946,Countless counterfeit medicines and pills are put into circulation through the Internet. Most of the counterfeiters ignore the current standards governing drug manufacture. Accordingly the products offered on the Internet are of questionable quality. The consequences often go beyond financial loss in particular there are inestimable repercussions in terms of damage to public health. Studies conducted by the World Health Organisation WHO have revealed that counterfeit medicines already account for one in ten medicinal products on the world market. The counterfeiting of medicinal products the fraud it involves and more importantly the danger to the health of people in dire need of help is tantamount to attempted mass murder as former European Commissioner GÊ_nter Verheugen phrased it back in 2009. Even now anything that brings in money  from the anti-flu drug Tamiflu to hair restorer  can still be found on the Internet. Like potency pills these items are falsified lifestyle products. 1. The EU Directive on prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products was published in July 2011. Under the directive medicinal products are to possess safety features which allow verification of the authenticity and identification of individual packs in the legal supply chain.

950,Yasuni National Park in  982 000 hectares of Amazon rainforest. It is the most biodiverse places on the planet 150 amphibian species 600 bird species 120 reptile species and 4 000 plant species. One hectare contains more native plant species than the United States and  In 1989 it was made a world biosphere reserve by Unesco. Yasuni is a quadruple richness centre or in other words has the maximum biodiversity of plants mammals amphibians and birds. In addition it borders the Waorani Ethnic Reserve a population which has shut itself off in a corner of the forest and asks only to be able to continue to live as it has done for thousands of years. Scientists maintain that the Waorani people have unique DNA characteristics due to their historical isolation. It would be a paradise were it not the case that in the subsoil there lies a vast amount of crude oil 846 million barrels with an estimated value of USD 7 billion which  would like to exploit. The President of Ecuador Rafael Correa has agreed not to exploit the oil reserves in return for USD 3.6 billion half of the value of the reserves to be paid over 13 years by the industrialised countries. Given the high level of corruption in the country the fund is managed by the United Nations. If by the end of 2011 Ecuador had not received USD 100 million the agreement made with the rest of the world would be cancelled. Germany has guaranteed USD 50 million for 10 years Italy has agreed to cancel the USD 51 million debt owed by Ecuador and Hollywood artists Al Gore national and local governments NGOs private organisations and businesses have begun making donations. The figure has reached USD 116 million enough to stop wells from being opened up. Correa is now requesting USD 291 million over the next two years otherwise the reservoir will be given under concession. But oil has not yielded the wealth that was promised in 1972 when the first barrel was extracted. Ecuador has remained poor and the wealth has gone to those who refined the oil outside the country. Can the Commission state 1. How it views the existence of Yasuni and the unique richness of its biodiversity 2. Whether as part of its geopolitical outlook it considers conserving this quintessential biosphere reserve to be vital 3.

955,The social and economic situation in many countries in Africa and the Middle East is creating increasing pressure at the EUs external borders. There are daily reports of substantial numbers of adults and children including  children entering the EU illegally and the governments of several southern European countries are asking the EU for help. Evidently the demographic trend in the Middle East and Africa is out of control and the substandard political social and economic development in those countries provides no opportunities for the soaring numbers of young people to obtain education work and housing. The sluggish rate at which the necessary changes are taking place in the countries of emigration means that developments over the next 10 to 20 years are crucial not only for those countries themselves but also for the EU.

977,The accession of new Member States to the EU should be put to full use. Within the internal market any pointless barriers at borders between present and future Member States will be fateful. In order to exploit the potential of enlargement and to foster the unity of the internal market governments should prevent short-sighted and groundless restrictions on the free movement of labour. It is insulting that States which as recently as December 2002 at Copenhagen promised to open their borders to workers from the new Member States should now put the gear into reverse and close their borders. In public the present Member States smile on workers from the future Member States but behind closed doors the Council adopts a different attitude. Such two-facedness is both unfair and unwise. According to the Commissions latest surveys even if no barriers are erected the number of workers wishing to move to the old Member States is likely to be substantially smaller than has been assumed and may even decline further. Moreover according to information which has been published the problems of the labour market were similarly overestimated at the time of previous enlargements when the southern European countries Spain Portugal and Greece joined the EU. A huge influx of foreign workers was expected but the number that actually came was not even sufficient. Moreover when the Commission surveyed the backgrounds of workers who were likely to move it was found that those keenest to do so tended to be highly trained or educated people with foreign language skills.

996,In the last five years much progress has been made by clothing and  towards improving the sustainability of their products  this includes the development of new ecotextiles the development of new energy sources and an increased effort to market the ethical nature of aspects of the production processes. However there is a lack of knowledge and awareness among EU consumers regarding where  from and how it is made. A lack of  EUwide eco-labelling system has created a market where there is  between brands that market their products as eco-friendly and planet-friendly. This has resulted in widespread consumer confusion and a growing scepticism among consumers as to which brands they can trust. The phenomenon of greenwashing  where consumers are being mislead by a multitude of different eco labels  has also lead to an increase in consumer scepticism and a reluctance on the part of consumers to trust the claims of sustainability made by many high-street brands. The introduction of an independent EUwide eco-labelling scheme would offer a simple effective and cheap method of restoring consumer faith in sustainable fashion and would encourage more consumers to make sustainable choices. Without accurate verifiable and recognisable information on the sustainability of their purchases EU consumers cannot make informed ethical choices about which brands they buy.

1008,In its answer of 21 December 1999 to the above Members first question on the Olbia tunnel E-2039/19991 the Commission only dealt with the environmental impact assessment issue. The questioner also mentioned the fact that ANAS the Italian highways authority hired the Roman firm Tor di Valle to build the tunnel instead of the elevated road section contrary to the provisions of the port master plan in force since 26 June 1981 and without issuing a call for tenders. Does the Commission not consider that to award the contract for the construction of the tunnel without issuing a call to tender contravenes European legislation on public contracts2 If it does what steps will it take to  with this legislation With regard to  on the environmental impact assessment aspect the Commission recognises that a preliminary assessment must be carried out to ascertain whether the project for the tunnel and the relevant sliproads should be subjected to an environmental impact assessment.

1014,Business in exporting and incinerating waste is booming particularly in Germany. In 2006 18 million tonnes of waste was exported to Germany including 5.6 million tonnes of toxic hazardous waste mostly from other EU countries. There are already 71 waste incineration plants and 80 more are planned or under construction. The existing waste incineration plants are not in any way working to capacity. Waste incineration in Germany is a lucrative business for  involved. 1. When authorisation is granted for the construction of a new waste incineration plant no assessment is required as to whether there is actually a need for a new plant. This virtually invites the construction of new plants.

How does the Commission respond to the fact that Germany is apparently  the number one country for waste incineration and that waste disposal is not contributing to environmental protection but  a business 3. How does the Commission respond to reports warning against the increase in pollution in areas surrounding waste incineration plants in Germany Do additional waste incineration plants not pose a hazard to health 4.

The report also concluded that there were major differences between Member States as far as the rules relating to access to data data protection data security and data retention time periods were concerned.

1019,AENA the Spanish airports and air traffic body is a  attached to Spains Ministry for Development. It is a monopoly that under the law is responsible for the management maintenance and administration of civilian public airports in Spain. AENA is the last centralised airport management body still operating in a large country in the developed world. Regional and local governments as well as the private sector are shut out. Several airlines including Singapore Airlines Ryanair and EasyJet have publicly criticised AENA accusing it of being biased in favour of Iberia and its hub in Madrid putting other airlines and other Spanish airports at a disadvantage. The head of Ryanair has said that AENAs airport tax policy does not make any sense. GermÊ_ Bel a professor of economics at Barcelona University said that it is absurd that AENA charges fees at Barcelona El Prat that are only slightly higher given the enormous difference in costs and  with Girona and Reus. The charges at El Prat should be raised and those at Girona cut. Barajas tops Europes list of loss-making airports because the taxes that AENA charges are far lower than the airports costs. This means that Iberias hub is effectively being subsidised with less pressure being brought to bear on Iberias flights than on those operated by low-cost airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet. Juanjo DurÊn the head of EasyJet in Spain has stated that AENA unlike most of the other airports in the world is unwilling  refusing to negotiate. He has also criticised AENAs lack of flexibility. This would explain the fact that Singapore Airlines has still not received the go-ahead for the Barcelona-SÊ£o Paulo route it requested at the beginning of 2010 see Written Question E5149/10. Might this be an attempt to protect the Madrid-SÊ£o Paulo flights that Iberia operates from Barajas In the light of the above I should like clear answers from the Commission to the following four questions 1. Does the Commission agree that AENAs actions constitute a clear breach of the principle of  and of the EUs internal market rules 2. What is the Commissions view on AENAs state aid in terms of other European airports 3.

Vegetables contaminated with the EHEC strain of E. coli have caused sudden attacks of food poisoning and cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome HUS. Fifteen people have already died as a result of this outbreak in Germany and other European countries including Sweden are now also starting to report deaths. According to reports from the German press agency DPA there were 460 cases on Tuesday 24 May and 600 on Wednesday 25 May. A case has also been reported in Poland. Initially the outbreak was thought to have been caused by contaminated cucumbers tomatoes and lettuce imported from Spain. Spains Agriculture Minister Rosa Aguilar however has vehemently refuted this claim. Meanwhile Cornelia PrÊ_fer-Storcks Hamburgs Senator for Health has publicly stated that the E. coli bacteria found on cucumbers imported from Spain were not the cause of the current outbreak in Germany and that the actual cause remains unclear. In the light of the above can the Commission state what action it has taken with a view to clearing up this matter establishing the cause of the outbreak once and for all and then eliminating it Which are at greater risk from this type of threat traditionally grown crops or organically grown ones Is the Commission currently monitoring the scale and scope of the risk of contamination If so what conclusions has the Commission reached What action is the Commission intending to take in  days and weeks,E-005727/2011,0,Over the last few day contaminated vegetable have been posing a major threat to the health and safety of the European public Vegetables contaminated with the EHEC strain of E coli have caused sudden attack of food poisoning and case of haemolytic uraemic syndrome HUS Fifteen people have already died a a result of this outbreak in Germany and other European country including Sweden are now also starting to report death According to report from the German press agency DPA there were case on Tuesday May and on Wednesday May A case ha also been reported in Poland Initially the outbreak wa thought to have been caused by contaminated cucumber tomato and lettuce imported from Spain Spains Agriculture Minister Rosa Aguilar however ha vehemently refuted this claim Meanwhile Cornelia Pr Ê ferStorcks Hamburgs Senator for Health ha publicly stated that the E coli bacteria found on cucumber imported from Spain were not the cause of the current outbreak in Germany and that the actual cause remains unclear In the light of the above can the Commission state what action it ha taken with a view to clearing up this matter establishing the cause of the outbreak once and for all and then eliminating it Which are at greater risk from this type of threat traditionally grown crop or organically grown one Is the Commission currently monitoring the scale and scope of the risk of contamination If so what conclusion ha the Commission reached What action is the Commission intending to take in day and week,-0.5973308,-0.5973308

1030,The German press has without any decisive evidence accused Spanish cucumber growers in Almeria and Malaga of being responsible for the Escherichia coli food contamination which has been detected in that country. There are various cucumber-growing regions in Spain including one in Roquetas de Mar Almeria and another in Algarrobo Malaga. They are separated by a distance of 150 km making it difficult for bacteria of faecal origin to contaminate crops so far away from each other. Furthermore the farms in question use drip irrigation which further reduces the possibility of contamination. Produce from these two areas in Spain is transported to the rest of Europe in separate trucks and there is no contact between them at any point until they reach a distribution centre in Northern Europe. Does the Commission agree that this calls for a thorough investigation from the place of production through to the point of sale to consumers in order to pinpoint the stage in the food chain at which the contamination took place Bearing in mind that chemical and bacteriological tests are carried out on all consignments before they leave our frontiers is it not likely that these two Spanish shipments were contaminated  into contact with other already contaminated products during handling at the distribution centre,P-005560/2011,0,The German press ha without any decisive evidence accused Spanish cucumber grower in Almeria and Malaga of being responsible for the Escherichia coli food contamination which ha been detected in that country There are various cucumbergrowing region in Spain including one in Roquetas de Mar Almeria and another in Algarrobo Malaga They are separated by a distance of km making it difficult for bacteria of faecal origin to contaminate crop so far away from each other Furthermore the farm in question use drip irrigation which further reduces the possibility of contamination Produce from these two area in Spain is transported to the rest of Europe in separate truck and there is no contact between them at any point until they reach a distribution centre in Northern Europe Does the Commission agree that this call for a thorough investigation from the place of production through to the point of sale to consumer in order to pinpoint the stage in the food chain at which the contamination took place Bearing in mind that chemical and bacteriological test are carried out on all consignment before they leave our frontier is it not likely that these two Spanish shipment were contaminated into contact with other already contaminated product during handling at the distribution centre,0.19659862,0.19659862

Our proposals introduce more economic rationale in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact while strengthening surveillance and enforcement. Press release IP/04/1062. On 14 December 2004 the Commission lifted all sanctions against France and Germany the eurozones two biggest economies over breaches of the 3 budget deficit ceiling - despite fears that Germany at least will fail  next year for the fourth consecutive year.

1032,The structure of the State of the Republic of Cyprus is exactly as set out in the provisions of its 1960 Constitution which has never been replaced and whose signatories include Turkey. The validity of the Constitution is reflected by the continued presence of British sovereign air bases in Cyprus whose status has never been officially queried as could be the case should the relevant agreements for any reason  invalid. It should be noted that there has never been a DE JURE separation between the Greek and Turkish peoples of Cyprus who have lived there in harmony for centuries. It is universally recognised that a supreme form of democratic expression is a referendum in which a sovereign people expresses itself as a body without racist divisions i.e. divisions based on race or religion concerning the future of the country. However the Annan peace plan for Cyprus - which was not drawn up by the EU - imposed a racist vote on the Cypriot people aggravating the division between Christians and Muslims regardless of the fact that a cornerstone of EU policy is non-discrimination on grounds of race or religion. What is the reason for the EUs continued support for the Annan peace plan with its total disregard for the Community acquiswhich was rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Greek population of Cyprus making up 82 of the officially registered population of the island as a whole Does Community law forbid the holding of a referendum in Cyprus with the entire people of the island voting as a single body on whether they wish to live as two separate states or one single state and on whether the island should be joined to another country Does the Commission know whether in any future British referendum for example on the adoption of the euro by the United Kingdom the citizens of Wales England Scotland and Northern Ireland will be called upon to vote separately Is it true that Kenan Akin a minister of the occupied territories wanted for the murder of Solomos Solomou a Cypriot citizen was arrested in Istanbul and subsequently released by the Turkish authorities despite an Interpol warrant for his arrest issued in 1996 Is Turkey entitled to ignore international arrest warrants,E-2537/04,0,The structure of the State of the Republic of Cyprus is exactly a set out in the provision of it Constitution which ha never been replaced and whose signatory include Turkey The validity of the Constitution is reflected by the continued presence of British sovereign air base in Cyprus whose status ha never been officially queried a could be the case should the relevant agreement for any reason invalid It should be noted that there ha never been a DE JURE separation between the Greek and Turkish people of Cyprus who have lived there in harmony for century It is universally recognised that a supreme form of democratic expression is a referendum in which a sovereign people express itself a a body without racist division ie division based on race or religion concerning the future of the country However the Annan peace plan for Cyprus which wa not drawn up by the EU imposed a racist vote on the Cypriot people aggravating the division between Christians and Muslims regardless of the fact that a cornerstone of EU policy is nondiscrimination on ground of race or religion What is the reason for the EUs continued support for the Annan peace plan with it total disregard for the Community acquiswhich wa rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Greek population of Cyprus making up of the officially registered population of the island a a whole Does Community law forbid the holding of a referendum in Cyprus with the entire people of the island voting a a single body on whether they wish to live a two separate state or one single state and on whether the island should be joined to another country Does the Commission know whether in any future British referendum for example on the adoption of the euro by the United Kingdom the citizen of Wales England Scotland and Northern Ireland will be called upon to vote separately Is it true that Kenan Akin a minister of the occupied territory wanted for the murder of Solomos Solomou a Cypriot citizen wa arrested in Istanbul and subsequently released by the Turkish authority despite an Interpol warrant for his arrest issued in Is Turkey entitled to ignore international arrest warrant,-0.112800986,-0.112800986

Denmark for example was recently threatened with being taken to the Court of Justice because the Commission considered that it had not done enough to protect the sensitive Tondermarsk area.

Denmark is currently planning to set up a test centre for wind turbines in an area of natural beauty near the Êãsterild dune plantation 12 km north-east of Thisted.

In the light of the above I would like to know how much importance the Commission attaches to environmental protection  to the erection of wind turbines. Does the Commission consider the visual and acoustic destruction of an area of natural beauty to be less important than erecting wind turbines because the latter involves an ideologically-motivated project founded on the utopian belief that all our climate problems can be solved on the basis of the naÊve assumption that Europes future energy needs can be satisfied by means of wind power and solar energy,E-2143/10,0,It knowledge that the EU take strong action whenever Member States fail to take nature into account Denmark for example wa recently threatened with being taken to the Court of Justice because the Commission considered that it had not done enough to protect the sensitive Tondermarsk area Only the swift intervention of the Danish Government prevented this happening Denmark is currently planning to set up a test centre for wind turbine in an area of natural beauty near the Ê ãsterild dune plantation km northeast of Thisted As a result the Danish Nature Protection Association ha applied for a protection order in order to prevent the destruction of this unique natural area In the light of the above I would like to know how much importance the Commission attache to environmental protection to the erection of wind turbine Does the Commission consider the visual and acoustic destruction of an area of natural beauty to be le important than erecting wind turbine because the latter involves an ideologicallymotivated project founded on the utopian belief that all our climate problem can be solved on the basis of the na Ê ve assumption that Europes future energy need can be satisfied by mean of wind power and solar energy,-0.28617376,-0.28617376

1044,According to a report published on the Internet1 the IMF proposed to the Eurozone governments to let Greece skip paying interest and principal until 2040. It also asked Europeans to extend the maturities of Greek bonds from 2040 to 2080 as well as to apply a fixed interest rate of 1.5 on the bailout loans for the next 30-40 years. Based on the most pessimistic scenario laid down by the Funds economists the IMF believes that in this way Greeces annual spending for servicing its debt will not go over 15 of its GDP. The Funds demands go way beyond the point up to which the EU is ready to help Greece to recover states the report adding that the Eurozone countries fronted by Germany are reluctant to make such sizeable concessions for the EUR 200 billion they have lent Greece.

1057,Under the EUIMF programme unemployment in Portugal has risen to an all-time high. Moreover countless thousands of unemployed people have lost their entitlement to the unemployment welfare benefits for which they contributed when in work. One of the consequences of this scenario has been a very sharp rise in emigration. Over the past weeks there have been numerous reports on the plight of many Portuguese citizens who have had no option but to leave their country. There are repeated cases of Portuguese citizens sleeping on the streets in cars at train stations and even in public toilets in the United Kingdom Luxembourg and Switzerland and there is also news of problems with workers in Belgium and the Netherlands. The charitable institutions including Catholic missions which have been asked to help feed these people are in despair and are calling for a concerted campaign to dissuade people from emigrating if they do not have contacts abroad and an employment contract.

1062,Developments with regard to the reopening of the Ijzeren Rijn line and the diffuse decision-making on the subject have been causing many people concern. Officially nothing has been decided but according to a press release of 21 September 2001 from the Netherlands Ministry of Transport and Public Works the transport ministers of the Netherlands and Belgium have reached a working agreement to adopt a decision on the reopening of the Ijzeren Rijn line. On 15 October the two ministers are to sign a memorandum of understanding. Meanwhile a consultation procedure is still in progress regarding the environmental impact of the proposed reopening of the line. Not only at local and regional provincial level is there a sense of growing astonishment at national level too people are asking why reasonable alternatives to the project are not being considered. It seems as if a political deal has been done between the Netherlands and Belgian Governments to ignore European and national rules and implement this project using the old route which passes straight through the De Meinweg and Weerter en Budeler Bergen nature areas. By revitalising the existing Montzen route R24 the 3.68 m tons of freight per annum currently being transported from the port of Antwerp to Duisburg could easily be doubled provided that certain adjustments were made to the Montzen line. According to information from the Government of Wallonia revitalisation would cost only  16 m. Have not  Belgian and Netherlands authorities ignored Directive 97/11/EC1 by not including the Montzen route option in the environmental impact assessment and does the Commission consider that an EIA ought now to be made which does include it There is a danger that the Habitats Directive and the Directive on Wild Birds will likewise be ignored by the Belgian and Netherlands authorities. There are no pressing reasons of major public importance why the Netherlands should reopen the old Ijzeren Rijn route. The purpose is to carry freight from the port of Antwerp which can just as well be done using the existing Montzen route.

Does the Commission agree about this It is apparent from the answers to question E-1216/002 14 April 2000 that the Commission did not receive a sufficiently prompt reply from the Netherlands to the question as to whether an appropriate assessment as referred to in Article 63 of Directive 92/43/EEC3 was made in relation to the possible impact of the Ijzeren Rijn project on De Meinweg and if so what its findings were.

Following its unacceptable insinuations against the Italian people as a whole in its coverage of rackets in Italian football it has once again provoked Greeks in an unacceptable manner  the last in a long series of such acts of provocation in its report of 5 and 6 July 2006 on elections in FYROM it continually used the term Macedonia despite the fact that it is well established that the EU only recognises the northern part of Greek territory as Macedonia.

1065,According to the Sunday Times on 7 July 2013 28 000 carcasses of cattle infected with the bovine tuberculosis bacillus are being exported from the UK each year to France Belgium and the Netherlands for consumption. Traceability is obviously not ensured as the batches are being shipped to Europe without any specific reference. French farmers are rightly worried by this because although France is free of bovine tuberculosis it has hit England hard. Controls on a number of cattle herds in France Belgium and Spain have confirmed the outbreak of Mycobacterium bovis causing great alarm among farmers who have had to have their infected animals slaughtered. Bovine tuberculosis  caused by Mycobacterium bovis  is spread among cattle through the inhalation of droplets infected by the bacillus and the consumption of grass contaminated by the bacteria. This form of TB can affect cattle but also many other wild or domestic animals. Since 2001 France has been considered officially free of bovine tuberculosis however every year it still affects a hundred or so farms despite the control measures in place. 1.

1071,On 4 February 2014 Human Rights Watch reported that Afghan law-makers are seeking approval from President Hamid Karzai for a new criminal procedure code that would effectively deny women protection from domestic violence and forced or child marriage. The new law has been passed in both houses of the Afghan Parliament and is expected to be sent to Karzai for final signature within a few weeks. In effect the law would prohibit the judicial authorities from questioning the relatives of a criminal defendant which would serve to silence victims of domestic violence. Family witnesses could choose not to testify which would make the prosecution of abusers extremely difficult. Article 26 Prohibition of Questioning an Individual as a Witness states that The following people cannot be questioned as witnesses  Relatives of the accused. The new code poses a serious threat to the critical protections for women and girls embodied in Afghanistans law on the Elimination of Violence against Women EVAW which was passed in 2009. This new criminal-procedure law follows several efforts by the Afghan Parliament to weaken already inadequate legal protections for women. Members of the Parliament opposed to womens rights have sought to repeal or weaken the EVAW law and in 2013 there were a number of high-profile attacks reported against female government and police officials. In addition in November a controversial draft law prepared by Afghan officials which would have reinstated public stoning as a punishment for adultery was stopped after it was leaked to the press. 1.

The forests survival is threatened by a whole range of factors which initially did not seem likely to cause major damage but which as they have mushroomed are destroying the ecosystem. The small roads built during the initial period of colonial settlement have proliferated following the construction of houses which have since  real cities. Working of the abundantly available wood was the main activity and many sawmills were set up and attracted thousands of people who did not live in the African continent. The closure of some establishments has forced unemployed people to look for  from another source poaching. Although forest rangers work hard  poaching without using weapons hoards of tusks have been discovered and then seized. The ivory that they contain was destined to be sold on the black market providing the poachers with substantial  as a result of the high prices for which it can be sold.

1083,A new analysis conducted by the Coalition for Energy Savings raises considerable doubt  with Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive EED which makes  every year for 3 of the total floor area of central government buildings to be renovated or for alternative measures that achieve the same impact to be implemented. According to the inventory just 11 of the 28 Member States have decided to renovate central government buildings which means that most Member States are opting for alternative measures. This also shows that Article 5 of the EED is not a sufficient incentive to prompt Member States to boost the building renovation market.

1087,The Torre Valdaliga Nord power station is currently being converted from oil to coal firing but in effect has been operating illegally since 24 December 2008 as it does not have the requisite integrated environmental authorisation AIA. The previous operating permit has expired and has not been renewed in line with Council Directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control 1. The Ministry of the Environment has not imposed any of the prescribed penalties and it is only in the last few days that the conferenza dei servizi conference of administrative departments involved in the project approval procedure at the Ministry of the Environment has been reconsidering the AIA in the light  of  filed by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of Health. Despite the fact that procedures have not  and the obvious omissions and irregularities that have occurred it appears that for the last 40 days ENEL has been operating the coal-fired part of the plant after having secretly stockpiled an initial 150 000 tonnes of coal. This was unloaded from three coal freighters using a dock which had not been approved for that purpose and an unfinished wharf designed for plaster and manufacturing waste. It appears that the coal-fired plant operates only at night without using the filters and the other equipment due to be installed to reduce emissions of oxides and dust. Coal was transferred from the ship to the storage area and to the burners without any regard for the rules protecting the health and safety of workers and without any fire-prevention equipment or equipment to monitor emissions of carbon monoxide and fire damp methane the flammable gas released by coal. The fuel is reportedly transferred between 4 pm and 8 pm in readiness for use at night with the result that although the effects are not visible dust and toxic substances are deposited on agricultural land and residential areas. These substances are not only detrimental to public health but also to the quality of agricultural products in an area noted for its high-quality food products.

1110,Recent events in the Russian Federation unfortunately show that human rights defenders in that country are still facing a very difficult situation. Despite the Russian Governments repeated assurances human rights activists in Russia are still being subjected to repression and intimidation. Activists are constantly detained and attacked while pressure is put on NGOs. Pressure on human rights activists was even stepped up in the runup to the EURussia summit. In an attempt to prevent any major demonstrations from taking place during the summit the Russian authorities called activists in for questioning and summoned them to the public prosecutors office where they were warned that participation in protests would not be permitted. On 6 June 2011 Bakhron Khamroyev an activist in a human rights organisation was attacked and seriously beaten. This attack is almost certainly linked to his professional activities Mr Khamroyev was preparing to take an active part in the hearing of a prisoner of Uzbek nationality. Regrettably such crimes often go unpunished in Russia. Last year the same activist was beaten unconscious by police officers who are yet to face justice for that crime. A strong protest needs to be registered at this wave of repression against human rights activists in the Russian Federation.

1128,The Court of First Instance of Al aaiun has sentenced Waleed Batal a Sahrawi journalist at Smara News to 14 months imprisonment. As a punishment for participating in the demonstrations for the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people in Smara he was arbitrarily detained two weeks ago. On the same day the occupying authorities of Morocco took the opportunity to try his father Salek Batal for participating in similar demonstrations in Smara in 2009. According to the judge the sentence will be sent to him by text message. The arbitrary nature of the charges and legal procedures are evidence of the colonial nature of the Moroccan administration in the occupied territories of Western Sahara. It is regrettable that the European Union is restricting itself to repeating that it is monitoring human rights and continuing political dialogue with Morocco without even raising the possibility of imposing sanctions given that the situation is worsening.

1129,On 16 May 1997 a local veterinary official in Latisana Udine blocked for 48 hours a lorry-load of 50 Rottweiler puppies and 20 pedigree kittens crowded into four containers designed to hold two. The lorry registration EJR832 which had arrived from Hungary by means of the Gorizia crossing and was bound for SARL Francis Duprat in Montespan France had no proper ventilation and had been closed for over 24 hours owing to engine problems. Having established that the animals which were in a disastrous state of health had been taken temporarily to the kennels in Porpetto Udine for appropriate treatment the local anti-vivisection league on the basis of the data in its possession asked for a check to be made on whether the carriers and those responsible for the delivery had infringed national law Law No 473 of 22 November 1993 on new rules against the maltreatment of animals amending Article 727 of the Criminal Code and Decree-Law No 532 of 30 December 1992 implementing Directive 91/628/EEC 1 on the protection of animals during transport.

1145,The European Union Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU recasting Directive 2002/95/EC restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacturing of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. This legislation has been important in removing toxic substances such as lead from many products found in peoples homes as well as reducing employees exposure during manufacture and preventing products containing such substances from entering landfill sites. Lead has been used in solder to reduce metal whiskering that is the formation of tiny crystalline hairs on metallic surfaces. Metal whiskering can be a cause of short-circuiting. Whilst a ban applicable to many consumer products was introduced in 2006 the legislation allowed exceptions for certain products such as medical devices until 2016 monitoring and control instruments until 2014 and industrial monitoring and control instruments until 2017. It should be noted that manufacturers have been addressing this issue in relation to devices such as IT  equipment since 2006 including within the aerospace sector.

1147,In 2001 an Italian woman married a Dutch man. From this union was born a child. The family residence was established in the Netherlands. In 2009 following judicially proven domestic violence against the woman she decided to ask for separation and protection measures. The court in the Netherlands despite the proven violence decided to grant joint custody of the child to both parents. In May 2009 while both parents were filing for divorce respectively in Holland and Italy a law entered into force that made the grant of a divorce subject to having previously the submitted a plan for custody of the child signed by the spouses jointly. The court imposed this condition and therefore forced the parents concerned to go to mediation without taking into account that the same law considered violence as cause that in itself would prevent mediation. In October 2009 the father was condemned by the Dutch court for domestic violence and abuse in a judgment that became res judicata. Nevertheless currently the Dutch court is still imposing forced mediation on the parents in order to grant the divorce but any form  is still extremely difficult and painful. 1.

1173,According to the Expedition Med report produced by the French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea and the University of Li?ge there are approximately 500 tonnes of plastic waste floating in the Mediterranean Sea. Researchers found that the concentration of pieces of plastic off the coasts of Spain France and northern Italy was much higher than in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The report also reveals that the highest concentration of plastic debris is to be found off the coast of the island of Elba where it is estimated to be in the region of 892 000 pieces per square  with an average of 115 000 per square kilometre. Experts have been given further cause for concern by a recent study entitled The impact of plastic and plastic bags on the marine environment. The Italian researchers responsible for the study reported that plastic is the main pollutant of Mediterranean waters representing 80  of all waste found in the sea a figure that rises to 90-95  in some areas. This is clearly an alarming state of affairs not least because floating plastic debris causes serious problems for shipping affecting its speed and efficiency. Equally as worrying is the fact that plastic is non-biodegradable which puts the Mediterranean Sea with its invaluable wealth of biodiversity at serious risk. It is estimated that 49 out of 115 marine mammal species are at risk of  entangled in plastic waste and every year plastic kills around 100 000 marine mammals as well as a significant number of sea turtles. Given the above would the Commission say 1. whether in its opinion a more in-depth analysis should be carried out in order to gain a clear picture of the extent and severity of the situation 2. what steps it intends to take if the above figures are confirmed to protect the biodiversity of marine life in the Mediterranean Sea which is a source of  for many European families 3. what steps it intends to take to safeguard the motorways of the sea  a transport system that is taking on ever greater importance particularly in light of the CO2 reduction targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy,E-007197/2011,0,According to the Expedition Med report produced by the French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea and the University of Lige there are approximately tonne of plastic waste floating in the Mediterranean Sea Researchers found that the concentration of piece of plastic off the coast of Spain France and northern Italy wa much higher than in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch The report also reveals that the highest concentration of plastic debris is to be found off the coast of the island of Elba where it is estimated to be in the region of piece per square with an average of per square kilometre Experts have been given further cause for concern by a recent study entitled The impact of plastic and plastic bag on the marine environment The Italian researcher responsible for the study reported that plastic is the main pollutant of Mediterranean water representing of all waste found in the sea a figure that rise to in some area This is clearly an alarming state of affair not least because floating plastic debris cause serious problem for shipping affecting it speed and efficiency Equally a worrying is the fact that plastic is nonbiodegradable which put the Mediterranean Sea with it invaluable wealth of biodiversity at serious risk It is estimated that out of marine mammal specie are at risk of entangled in plastic waste and every year plastic kill around marine mammal a well a a significant number of sea turtle Given the above would the Commission say whether in it opinion a more indepth analysis should be carried out in order to gain a clear picture of the extent and severity of the situation what step it intends to take if the above figure are confirmed to protect the biodiversity of marine life in the Mediterranean Sea which is a source of for many European family what step it intends to take to safeguard the motorway of the sea a transport system that is taking on ever greater importance particularly in light of the CO reduction target set by the Europe strategy,-0.20221075,-0.20221075

1175,On 31 March 2012 support for the processing of dried fodder will be removed. Since the mid-term review and the partial decoupling of EU support European production of dried fodder has progressively dropped from 5 to 3.5 million tonnes. The survival of the Italian sector is in danger to the detriment of 15 000 workers including 900 employees 10 000 farmers and 4 000 related industries in addition to a drastic reduction in the surface area given over to alfalfa. In certain areas of Italy approximately 80 000 hectares are planted with alfalfa and the crop prospers because there are processing plants in the area despite there being no livestock farms. Without such farms there is a lack of manure but soil fertility is assured by the cultivation of alfalfa. The possible closure of the processing plants the lack of livestock farms and  from cereals and biomass crops would put this crops cultivation at risk as there would be no room for it. When processed alfalfa is the EUs highest source of protein 2 500 kg protein/hectare. It is a catch crop because  it fixes atmospheric nitrogen and does not require nitrogenised manures herbicides or pesticides  it sanitises groundwater  it has an anti-erosive action  it helps fight the greenhouse effect  it prepares soils for organic cultivation. The only hope for survival of the sector now lies in Article 38 voluntary coupled support of the new CAP which would provide aid for farmers growing alfalfa for processing. In the light of the above can the Commission state  whether more effective measures are envisaged for access of dried fodder to Article 38 in order to avoid market distortion as has been the case with Article 68 under which France was given access to support EUR 120/hectare while Italy was definitively excluded  IT C 210 E 24/07/2013,E-002202/2012,0,On March support for the processing of dried fodder will be removed Since the midterm review and the partial decoupling of EU support European production of dried fodder ha progressively dropped from to million tonne The survival of the Italian sector is in danger to the detriment of worker including employee farmer and related industry in addition to a drastic reduction in the surface area given over to alfalfa In certain area of Italy approximately hectare are planted with alfalfa and the crop prospers because there are processing plant in the area despite there being no livestock farm Without such farm there is a lack of manure but soil fertility is assured by the cultivation of alfalfa The possible closure of the processing plant the lack of livestock farm and from cereal and biomass crop would put this crop cultivation at risk a there would be no room for it When processed alfalfa is the EUs highest source of protein kg proteinhectare It is a catch crop because it fix atmospheric nitrogen and doe not require nitrogenised manure herbicide or pesticide it sanitises groundwater it ha an antierosive action it help fight the greenhouse effect it prepares soil for organic cultivation The only hope for survival of the sector now lie in Article voluntary coupled support of the new CAP which would provide aid for farmer growing alfalfa for processing In the light of the above can the Commission state whether more effective measure are envisaged for access of dried fodder to Article in order to avoid market distortion a ha been the case with Article under which France wa given access to support EUR hectare while Italy wa definitively excluded IT C E,-0.46143946,-0.46143946

The Commission states that publicly owned port undertakings perform economic operations and  with private undertakings which are required to pay corporation tax. The Commission sees this as placing the private undertakings at  disadvantage. However Dutch port  not with private businesses based in the Netherlands but with other European sea ports. A survey by Ernst  Young indicates that port undertakings in Germany Belgium and France do not pay corporation tax or equivalents to it.

1221,Water has always been a problem throughout the world there are those who consume too much those who have no access to it and those who even waste huge amounts. In various parts of the world the uncertainty of available drinking water is an everyday problem for thousands of people in some countries water use is mainly a luxury rather than something that is available to poor indigenous families. The waste of this key resource in luxury hotels is managing not only to damage the economic system but also the environment since it contaminates river water in villages. Fresh abundant and decontaminated water is available to resorts and their guests while local people suffer from thirst and diseases caused by the polluted water they consume. Tour operators and hotel chains directly benefit from this at the expense of a weak and poor population. Water resources have always been exploited for luxury goods and consumption rather than for helping to prevent nutritional insecurity for many people who are left to fend for themselves. What a hotel room consumes in one day in a developing country would help an entire village for at least a couple of days. In addition to this sad  water wells are gradually being abandoned precisely because of the pollution of the aquifers. Even houseboats for tourists are highly polluting and harmful to the water and are affecting fisheries and therefore local economies. Given that nowadays in remote corners of the planet lack of water is a constant daily struggle for thousands of people who have no access even to drinking water while in other parts of the world water is wasted at the expense of these already disadvantaged populations can the Commission say whether it will take action on the sensitive issue of water provision to all regardless of social class  IT C 308 E 23/10/2013,E-007936/2012,0,Water ha always been a problem throughout the world there are those who consume too much those who have no access to it and those who even waste huge amount In various part of the world the uncertainty of available drinking water is an everyday problem for thousand of people in some country water use is mainly a luxury rather than something that is available to poor indigenous family The waste of this key resource in luxury hotel is managing not only to damage the economic system but also the environment since it contaminates river water in village Fresh abundant and decontaminated water is available to resort and their guest while local people suffer from thirst and disease caused by the polluted water they consume Tour operator and hotel chain directly benefit from this at the expense of a weak and poor population Water resource have always been exploited for luxury good and consumption rather than for helping to prevent nutritional insecurity for many people who are left to fend for themselves What a hotel room consumes in one day in a developing country would help an entire village for at least a couple of day In addition to this sad water well are gradually being abandoned precisely because of the pollution of the aquifer Even houseboat for tourist are highly polluting and harmful to the water and are affecting fishery and therefore local economy Given that nowadays in remote corner of the planet lack of water is a constant daily struggle for thousand of people who have no access even to drinking water while in other part of the world water is wasted at the expense of these already disadvantaged population can the Commission say whether it will take action on the sensitive issue of water provision to all regardless of social class IT C E,-0.2796637,-0.2796637

1223,In answer to Question E-007462/2012 on ETS for greenhouse horticulture businesses the Commission states that no other Member State apart from the Netherlands has explicitly excluded those horticulture sector installations which are covered by the scope of the ETS Directive. The Commission further states that for the third trading period 20132020 installations such as cogeneration plants may only be excluded from the EU ETS if they have a rated thermal input of less than 35 MW. To determine whether the maximum capacity of 35 MW has been reached at a particular firm it is important to know whether this capacity applies to each individual installation or to all the machines located together at an industrial site. 1. What does the Commission understand by the term installation as used in the EU ETS Directive Must this be taken to mean each individual installation or must this term be understood to mean all the installations located together at one location/establishment 2. In short is a location with three installations each with an individual rated thermal input of less than 35 MW but with  input of more than 35 MW covered by the ETS Directive or by national regulations 3. How have the Member States transposed this definition of installation from the ETS Directive into national legislation Have they done so in the same way Do some Member States calculate the capacity based on individual installations while other Member States use the  capacity at one location 4. In its answer the Commission also stated that the ETS is primarily intended for larger installations and that national regulations apply to smaller ones. Consequently the level playing field between firms in the same sector might be affected. To what extent do Member States have the opportunity to correct distortions in the level playing field between firms with installations covered by the ETS on the one hand and firms covered by national regulations on the other,E-002887-13,0,In answer to Question E on ETS for greenhouse horticulture business the Commission state that no other Member State apart from the Netherlands ha explicitly excluded those horticulture sector installation which are covered by the scope of the ETS Directive The Commission further state that for the third trading period installation such a cogeneration plant may only be excluded from the EU ETS if they have a rated thermal input of le than MW To determine whether the maximum capacity of MW ha been reached at a particular firm it is important to know whether this capacity applies to each individual installation or to all the machine located together at an industrial site What doe the Commission understand by the term installation a used in the EU ETS Directive Must this be taken to mean each individual installation or must this term be understood to mean all the installation located together at one locationestablishment In short is a location with three installation each with an individual rated thermal input of le than MW but with input of more than MW covered by the ETS Directive or by national regulation How have the Member States transposed this definition of installation from the ETS Directive into national legislation Have they done so in the same way Do some Member States calculate the capacity based on individual installation while other Member States use the capacity at one location In it answer the Commission also stated that the ETS is primarily intended for larger installation and that national regulation apply to smaller one Consequently the level playing field between firm in the same sector might be affected To what extent do Member States have the opportunity to correct distortion in the level playing field between firm with installation covered by the ETS on the one hand and firm covered by national regulation on the other,-0.51269746,-0.51269746
